         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the greateſt troubles that ever befell many of Gods people, I appeal to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall experiences, is, thoſe fiery darts, which the Devil by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> doth continually caſt at them; and it muſt needs be a trouble, yea a wounding trouble, to thoſe that have ever in truth taſted of the goodneſſe of God in our Lord Jeſus, and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the trials are fiery; Take a flaſh of fire, and caſt it ſuddenly in a mans face in a dark night, and it will cauſe a ſudden aſtoniſhment to ceaze upon him: theſe <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> darts, in private meditations are many times caſt in the face of a Saint, which doth prove worſe then a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flaſh of fire in the night, cauſing him to be taken with a deeper amazement, in ſuch a manner, that he ſcarce knows either where he is, or what he is. Firſt, he knows not where he is, whether in heaven, or hell; in the light, or in darknes. Suppoſe a man were to go a journey for his life, in ſuch a way wherein he never was before, and in his way lies many croſſe wayes, ſo that he knows not which to turn to, he muſt needs be but in a poore condition, except he have a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113757:6"/>perſon with him to direct him, that knows all wayes, and a principle in him to underſtand a direction. A Chriſtians way is very difficult, and troubleſome, eſpecially in ſuch a caſe as this, when his deſire is to injoy moſt ſweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant communion with God, which he eſteems and values above his life; but for the in oyment and continuance of this, he knows not which way to take too, or perſevere in; ſeeing many wayes before him, he muſt needs hang down his head like a bulruſh, untill he meet with the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, that knows all wayes without him, and within him alſo, and is both able and willing to give him know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, which way to take to, when he is at ſuch a ſtand, or in ſuch an amazement as this is, although he was never with his dear Saviour, ſo far in his way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now for thy conſolation, conſider three things. Firſt, Chriſt is a Chriſtians guide, a Chriſtians comfort, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians companion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt, who is a Chriſtians way, is a Chriſtians guide alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 18. Chap. 17. 20. Thou canſt not have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter guide then Jeſus Chriſt is; he knows all myſteries and ſecrets, all the cloſe chelled wayes of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> with all the multitudes and numberleſſe numbers of them, although they lie never ſo ſecretly in the bowels of darknes yet they are all naked and open before him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.50. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.25. And this muſt needs be ſo for theſe Reaſons. Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt was before all things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.58.

If thou haſt Chriſt to be thy guide, thou mayeſt without fear encounter with the whole world. <hi>David</hi> could do more with a ſling and a ſtone, then the whole Army of Iſrael could, becauſe God was his guide, and did guide the ſtone alſo that went out of his hand. Though many <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Goliahs</hi> come againſt thee, boaſting of their ſtrength, taking it diſdainfully that ſuch a one as thou art ſhould offer to come againſt them, ſuppoſing to make but a ſhrimp of thee, and thy imaginary God and Saviour, as they call

               <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt is a Chriſtians comfort too, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. Chap. 14.27. although thy way be troubleſome in this and many other reſpects, an evil heart and ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, many able ſubtle Antichriſts without thee, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in a black ſhape ſaith, that this viſible world, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things thereof, is thy onely comfort; in a bright or Antichriſtian ſhape he ſaith, that religion muſt needs be thy onely comfort, he hath preſented many Religions to thee, but to thy ſpirit being made ſpirituall, none of them will pleaſe thee; this is the laſt, the greateſt and brighteſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that he hath to ſhew thee, and that which of all his ſhapes, appearances, or Religions, is the moſt likeſt unto God; this is the greateſt kingdom, the higheſt heaven, and glory, the lovelieſt, and ſweeteſt ſhape or form that poſſibly he can deviſe, or imagine to cheat thee withall: if thou knoweſt him, or art able to hold faſt thy comfort the Lord Jeſus, thou haſt quite diſheartned him, and foiled him for ever; God will manifeſt himſelf unto thee, and in that ſight will ſhew thee all things. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.45, 46. and 17.24. Chap. 14.21. He will ſhew thee what the devil is in all forms, he will acquaint thee with his appearance in darkneſſe, then when he leaves off that ſhape, and transforms himſelf ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly in to a glorious Angels likeneſſe; the Lord will ſhew thee that it is the ſame devil, though in another appearance, he will manifeſt him to thee, as he cunningly under this notiond wels in Antichriſt, and as he ſecretly lodges in thy own ſpirit: conſider of the love of God to thee, in reſpect of theſe reall laſting conſolations; let the devil ſpeak in never ſo many languages and forms, yet that power by which he was created will uphold and refreſh thy languiſhing ſpirit.</p>
               <p>O man, whoſoever thou art, whoſe ſpirit the Lord hath kept, from being overwhelmed by the powers of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113757:7"/>I pray thee further to conſider of the love of God, in two reſpects; in its greatneſſe, in its goodneſſe. Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of Gods love in reference to its greatneſſe, the perſonal glory of the Lord Jeſus, is the exceeding greatneſſe of Gods love. The ſecond thing is, that the perſon or glory of Chriſt, is the exceeding goodneſſe of Gods love, the infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable glory of Chriſt is, his heavenly being in the bleſſed Trinity: where can you ſee a greater manifeſtation of Gods greatneſſe, then to look upon the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, both meeting in the perſon of our Saviour. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>vlt.</hi> Again, where can you ſee a greater diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Gods love in the goodneſſe thereof, then by ſeeing that Jeſus in whom the fulneſſe of God dwelleth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. and 2.4. this is a Chriſtians revivall in the ſaddeſt and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt condition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt will be thy companion alſo, he will not leave thee upon any terms, though thou art filthy and unworthy of him, and wouldeſt often forſake him if he did not keep thee. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Job.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a thouſand men were travelling in a wildernes, and they ſhould ſee ſo many wilde beaſts coming to devour them; ſuppoſe that the third part of them ſhould conſult and conclude, to take ſome courſe for to a void this danger, but the other that out of ſome fuller knowledge of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way, which they all take not, leave their company, and refuſes all their virgin forcing Reaſons and Arguments; yet it would be a great temptation and provocation to them, to draw them away from that way of ſafety, which by their knowledge was ſo ſeated in them. Many men are profeſſors of the Goſpel, in this world which is a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to a Saint, and in their profeſſing or travelling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do meet with many enemies devouring and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at once according to their power all that is before them: A Chriſtian ſees many Councils held, and many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conclude, ſome to worſhip God in this way, ſome in that, he knows and apprehends by the teachings of the Spirit, that moſt, if not all of theſe wayes are deſtructive,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113757:7"/>dangerous, and erroneous; this fight ſaddens a Chriſtian, that moſt of his friends and acquaintance ſhould leave him alone as it were ſingle in judgement: yet not alone, for the bleſſed Trinity is with him, God is in Chriſt, the Spirit is in both, and Chriſt is in a Chriſtian. Now were it not for this glorious company, how ſad, lowe, and miſerable would his condition be! it would go worſe with him if he were left and ſtript of all, as ſometimes for a time many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians are, then with a thouſand others; and why, becauſe he hath in truth, ſeen, known, and injoyed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in the Spirit; and now to be left, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken is worſe, and more dreadfull to him, then to them who never had a true fight and injoyment of Chriſt at all. Suppoſe a Kings Son that is born to be an heir to Crowns and Kingdoms, ſhould come to be a begger, beggery would be more tedious to him being a Prince, and ſuch an Heir, then to him who hath been ſo from his cradle. Let all men ſay what they will or can of God, with never ſuch eloquent glorious phraſes and expreſſions, yet if they once come to take away a Chriſtians Chriſt from him,

See the <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> That there is nothing in the creature but is the Creator. pa. 77.</note> then he knows what will follow: though many do come and tell him, that they can live ſweetly and quietly upon this conſideration, that God by aſſuming of humane nature, becomes al things in man, and man by being divine, by being deified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all things in God, with ten thouſand times more, yet all this will not give ſatisfaction, to him there is no life or goodneſſe, no heaven neither of grace nor glory, but all things out of order in reſpect of him, if God in Jeſus Chriſt be not within him; his actions are kingly and royall, like an Ambaſſadour, whoſe buſineſſe is moſt of all with the King: So tis with a Chriſtian, all his work and ſpirituall imployment in this world from the wombe to the grave, is with Jeſus Chriſt. I ſay again, tis with a particular cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Jeſus; take him out of his Saviours company, and he is like a man that hath never a hand to work with; or if he have, there is no ſtrength in them, but goes about all things in a fumbling, confuſed, diſtracted manner, not knowing where nor when to begin or make an end. A Chriſtian is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113757:8"/>not himſelf, nor in his right minde, when he is not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to come a little cloſer to the matter, which by way of confutation I deſire to inform you of, which are as ſo many ſpears thruſt thorow the heart of Chriſt and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; the heart of Chriſt is the Spirit, the heart of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is Chriſt, who is this Spirit. The method that I ſhall uſe is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſet down the errours, laying them open and naked to thy view.</p>
               <p>Secondly, lay down the truth, by which I deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them. Tis true, that one of them includes and contains them all, and whatſoever elſe they can deviſe to write or ſay.

               </head>
               <p>I Shall lay open this Errour to you thus: there is but one Spirit in the world, that is, there is but one ſpirit or life, internall fire, heat or motion in all things whatſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, in God, in good Angels, as we call them, in devils, as we term them, in all creatures, and in all the ſons and daughters of men.</p>
               <p>The confutation. I do not know any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but that there is and may be ſeemingly, or for want of knowledge, ſome difference amongſt them; but this I ſay, that he that holds not cloſely and firmly to this one ground and principle, cannot be an abſolute able direct, but muſt needs be a neutrall Familiſt. The truth that I ſhall lay down is this; that this expreſſion, theſis, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is an erroneous Antichriſtian blaſphemy: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:113757:8"/>is erroneous is Antichriſtian; whatſoever is Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in this ſence concerning the eſſence or being of God, is blaſphemy. Tis treaſon for any man but the King, to ſay that he is the King; tis treaſon, rebellion, and blaſphemy againſt God, for any man to ſay, that that which is created and finite, is the Infinite and Eſſentiall Godhead. I ſhall prove that to be an undeniable truth which I have to ſay to you concerning this firſt Errour, both by Scripture and Reaſons, making it clearly manifeſt, that there are more ſpirits in the world then one, and that the life and being of man and all creatures is not the life and being of God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Dearly beloved, beleeve not every ſpirit, but try the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whether they are of God, for many falſe prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> Let us ſolidly and lovingly ſearch out this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and ſee what this ſpirituall and divine truth will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us; you may plainly ſee, that theſe words are an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, a concluſion, and a. Reaſon, all which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with theſe two loving foregoing expreſſions, <hi>Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leved,</hi> the exhortation lies in theſe words, <hi>Beleeve not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God:</hi> the Reaſon lies in theſe words; <hi>For many falſe prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> The concluſion is this; that there are more ſpirits in the world then one: And it lies in theſe words, <hi>ſpirits and prophets,</hi> ſpeaking in the plurall number. Then there is another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and that is this, that <hi>every ſpirit is not of God,</hi> ver. 2. and 3. It is impoſſible that one ſpirit ſhould act in ſuch a way of oppoſition, or contrariality, as theſe two ſpirits do which the Apoſtle gives a deſcription of. The good Spirit which is of God, is known by this action, which is a reall confeſſion and acknowledgement of the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh: The other ſpirit is known by another contrary work, <hi>viz.</hi> to deny this Chriſt in his coming.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that I ſhall obſerve from theſe Scriptures, is this, What manner of Chriſt is this that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, is it a particular body, a perfect man, which God created and aſſumed in the wombe of that Virgin that was for this end ordained, and ſet apart by God from eternity; I mean that Virgin which was eſpouſed or affianced to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113757:9"/>
                  <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Mary;</hi> or is it a univerſall Chriſt, as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> cals him, that is, the fleſh and blood of the whole world, to which this Scripture with many others is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. laſt: <hi>Without controverſie great is the myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, viz:</hi> God manifeſted in the fleſh, that is, God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the fleſh of all men, which fleſh, outward form, body, or orgine,

That if we deal with the paſſion of Chriſt in himſelf it muſt be imaginary, but if we look upon it as it is in our ſelves, it is not then to be imagined, but beheld, juſt ſuch as we feel in our ſelver really. p 211. l. 17.18.</note> was created by one life, good or God which is eternall; and this good, God, or life eternall, in creating this man, did aſſume it, and by aſſuming or uniting it to himſelf, Godhead, or eſſence, doth make out a diſcovery and manifeſtation of himſelf, to himſelf, in and by all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The firſt I acknowledge to be the truth, and of Chriſt: the ſecond I prove to be falſe, and of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> one Scripture hath dependance upon another, like a golden chain, break one link, and you break all; deny one truth, and you deny all. Compare one ſpirituall truth with another, and that is the onely way by the Spirit, to finde out the ſpirituality of all truth. Theſe Scriptures that I am now treating or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, are ſufficient witneſſes to juſtifie or bear me out in all theſe inferences or concluſions that I have drawn from them. But beſides theſe, I ſhall produce many others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this truth, which is ſo plain, that the devil and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> in all their appearances cannot deny, I mean in ſuch a manner, ſo as to take away the eſſence and being of it out of the world, I mean a new creation, the heart of a true beleever.</p>
               <p>The other Scriptures are theſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 27.28. ſo onward to the 55. I pray you read this Hiſtory in love to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, without any ſelfiſh by-reſpect either to your ſelves, or to any perſon in this world; if any will deny a particular crucified Jeſus, he muſt race and blot out all theſe with many other Scriptures, concerning this: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14.27.

This is a reall truth, all the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts</hi> in the world cannot nullifie or make it of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that Jeſus Chriſt is a particular man, in which nature he ſuffered, and in which he is alſo glorified. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7, 8. And the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>there is but one Mediator between God and man, which is the man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> The Reaſons or Arguments are of two ſorts: the firſt ſort is to prove, that there are more ſpirits in the world then one. Secondly, that the life and being of God, is not every thing, and that every thing is not the life, eſſence, and being of God. The other ſort of Reaſons is to prove, that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh. Secondly, that this Jeſus, is a particular Saviour, ſuch a one as had, and ſtill hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſoul and body, that was created in the wombe of the Virgin, for the falling and riſing of many in Iſrael. Now the firſt Argument for the confutation of this firſt errour, <hi>viz.</hi> that the life of man and all creatures is God, which is one Spirit, beſides whom there is no other, is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whatſoever is the Godhead or eſſence, the name of that is uncommunicable, thy name alone is Jehovah, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.18. <hi>I am that I am,</hi> all in all, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. But the name of man in reference to his Spirit is not uncommunicable, therefore the life of man or all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is not God. I will ſpeak a little of the Name of God under this threefold conſideration. Firſt, the Name of God is ſuch an infinite glory, that it cannot be attributed, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113757:10"/>communicated to any creature either in heaven or earth, an Angel is not Jehovah, the ſpirit of a man is not the Name of God; Jeſus Chriſt in reference to his conception and creation, is not this God, or Name Jehovah. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Name of God is <hi>I am that I am, all in all,</hi> but no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <hi>I am:</hi> The word ſignifies, all that God is in himſelf, in his attributes, in all creatures, it diſcovers his eternity, immutability, bleſſedneſſe, and perfection. Thirdly, the Name of God is <hi>All in all,</hi> all in all things, all before all things, all above all things, all beſides all things: but I will ſpeak more of this anon, for the preſent I deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this, whatſoever is the Godhead or eſſence is alſo the bleſſed Trinity; for the Godhead is the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, and the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt is one and the ſame God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11. But the life and ſpirit of man and all creatures is not the bleſſed Trinity. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the life of all creatures is not God. The <hi>major</hi> Propoſition is clear, the aſſumption alſo is undeniable. Yet I ſhall open and inlarge this Argument, by theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. The Godhead is the Father, God is a Father in three reſpects. Firſt, he is the Father of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. Secondly, God is the Father of a Chriſtian. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. Chap. 10.17. Thirdly, God is a Father to all creatures both in heaven and earth. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.15. The ſpirit of man is not the Father of Chriſt, of a Chriſtian, and of all creatures: therefore not God. Tis true, many men care not what they ſay, although never ſo blaſphemous, and will ſtand to avouch whatſoever they think or apprehend, to be truth, and of God, though never ſo falſe. And why, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conceive it to be ſo, and therefore it cannot be otherwiſe. It is not mens right apprehenſions of truth that gives being to it, but it doth give being to all things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Godhead is the Son alſo, yet ſo as that he is the Father too: this is that very God, and that eternall life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. there is no other God, or eternall life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Godhead of our bleſſed Saviour the perſon of Chriſt was begotten, but the Godhead of our Lord Jeſus is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113757:10"/>not onely the Word begotten, but the Father begetting, and the bleſſed Spirit which in its perſon proceeds from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. Thirdly, the holy Spirit in its Godhead, is, not onely the third perſon in the Trinity, but every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. The three perſons in the Trinity, are all one God, which is a Spirit; the ſpirit of man, in man is not the perſon, nor Godhead, neither of the Spirit, or our Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The third Argument is this: God is immutable, eternall, alſufficient, and infinite: but the ſpirit and life of man and all creatures is not ſo, therefore is it not God. Firſt, the ſpirit of man is not immutable or unchangeable, he is not alwayes of one minde, deſiring, imbracing, loving, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting of one thing, but is flexable, to day for one thing, to morrow for another; now for Chriſt, and anon for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Can any man deny this which we know to be true by our daily experiences. Secondly, no man is eternall, not ſo eternall as God is; he is the Father of eternity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> without beginning, without end: <hi>Revel.</hi> the beginning and end of all things. Thirdly, no man is alſufficient for himſelf, for any weighty ſpirituall imployment, nor for any friend or creature to ſave or deſtroy, to help him in a trouble or out of trouble; many things, yea all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſtrength and aſſiſtance of God is impoſſible to him; to God all things are poſſible. Laſtly, no man is infinite in power or wiſdom, glory or mercy; man, inſtead of being infinite, is impotent, impudent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whatſoever is God, hath infinite and eternall communion with God: but the life and Spirit of man, and all creatures is not infinite, and eternal in their communion with God; therefore the life and ſpirit of all creatures is not God</p>
               <p>Fifthly, whatſoever is the eſſence or Godhead, is alſo the whole diſcovery and manifeſtation of the minde of God in Jeſus Chriſt, for God is his own diſcoverer: but the ſpirit of man is not able to reveal the whole minde of God in Jeſus Chriſt concerning all things. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the life of man is not God.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113757:11"/>
               <p>Sixthly, whatſoever is God is without meaſure, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine hature of God, for it is the Nature it ſelf: but all creatures without meaſure are not partakers of the Divine nature of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all the creatures are not God.</p>
               <p>Now to prove the other truth concerning Jeſus Chriſt, in reſpect of his coming in the fleſh, it ſhall be when I ſhall come to handle ſuch matter, as that I ſhall have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to take it in in order. Therefore I deſire to go on in the proſecution of what is in hand, it being a truth of a high concernment, that we are all bound and ingaged to inquire into.</p>
               <p>The being, nature, and eſſence of the Almighty God, is ſuch, that we may quickly and eaſily be miſtaken in our higheſt and greateſt meditations we may think that to be God, which in truth is not God; and think alſo that not to be God, which in truth is God. The true and reall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is the foundation of all Chriſtian Religion; if a man be not ſpiritually firm, and ſound in this one main principle, he muſt needs be ſandy in all; the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God will bring a man to the knowledge of all things. <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>b.</hi> 17.3. Chap. 14.7.17. The knowledge of God is that that makes us to imbrace him, to love and exalt him above all, to worſhip and obey him in the ſpirit. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. Suppoſe the King ſhould give a rich Jewel to a poore childe, although it were worth many thouſands, yet he would not look upon it or eſteem of it any more then an ordinarie ſtone or trifle. What is the cauſe why the men of this world do ſlight and undervalue the glory and excellency of the Lord Jeſus, and do exalt and embrace this preſent evill world, and the glory thereof, but becauſe they never have ſeen him nor known him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.19. Chap. 15.21.24.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Reaſon to prove that the life and ſpirit of all things is not God, is this: God is above all things, but the ſpirit of man is not above all: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſpirit of man is not God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31.</p>
               <p>Again, eightly, God is alſo the Creator, preſerver, and governour of all things both in heaven and earth: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.49, 50. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. But the ſpirit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113757:11"/>of man in the higheſt reſpect cannot rule it ſelf, neither is it the Creator, preſerver, and governour of all things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſpirit is not God.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that that is the Godhead or eſſence doth all things according to the good pleaſure of his will, and worketh all after the counſell of the ſame. <hi>Act</hi> 4.28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. But it is impoſſible that ever this ſhould be done by man, and blaſphemy it is to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not God. This errour is not onely againſt the Scriptures, but alſo againſt all Reaſon both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane; pull down this pillar, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this myſterie will quickly fall to the ground: this is the firſt and greateſt principle, if they forſake this, they can hold forth nothing either in preaching, diſputing, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but what ſhall be ſo confuſed and intricate, that a man ſhall hardly know where they begin, what they ſpeak of, or where they will end. Thus much for the firſt Errour. The ſecond in order by way of confutation is this.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Whether all things are the act of God, yea, or not. Whether every creature in all its actions, be acted and ruled by the Spirit of God: the truth is acknowledged, the errour explicated and confuted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have included this in the generall, in what I have ſaid before; I will now ſpeak of it in particular. Let us now ſee wherein this is a truth according to Scriptures, and then I'le ſet down the contrary Antichriſtian falſhood: I intreat you to conſider what I ſhall ſay, without miſtaking or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehending of me, that none may juſtly ſay, that I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to call out or confute many Antichriſts without me, by a greater and a ſubtiller Antichriſt within me: The truth is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God is the ſupream, chief, and onely Ruler of all things both in heaven and earth; all ſorts of creatures, whether angels, devils, or men, all creatures, all things
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113757:12"/>whatſoever without exception, are under his power and heavenly juriſdiction: No man, Angel, or devil can rule and diſpoſe of himſelf according to his own will and pleaſure, in any condition, work, or action whatſoever, contrary to Gods eternall will, counſell, and determination. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf: it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi> The power by which all men doth turn and winde their hearts and hands to do all things is of God. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Once have I ſaid it, yea twice, that power belongs to God.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. that <hi>there it no power but of God. Matth.</hi> 28.18. our Saviour ſaith, that <hi>all power it mine both in heaven and earth:</hi> Joh. 17.2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the way in which man walketh, is not in himſelf, but in him that created him. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. Every mans being, life, and motion, is in God. Secondly, there is nothing that can have a being in this world, which is abſolutely againſt the will of God; if the devil had not been ordained from all eternity, for that condition into which he fell, then had he never fallen into it: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. they that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected could never fall: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.21. Thirdly, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world whatſoever that is abſolutely evil under all conſiderations, but in ſome reſpects is neceſſarily good, and muſt needs be; the greateſt evil in the world is the ſins of the world: now ſin although it be the greateſt evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. yet in ſome reſpects 'tis good and abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and muſt needs be in the world; <hi>Of him, to him, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row him are all things, Rom:</hi> 11.36. that is, in reference to his eternall purpoſe, counſell, and determination. The devil as a devil is not of God; ſin in reference to it ſelf is not of God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. for all that is in this world, as the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of this world. The ſins of the whole world, are comprehended under theſe three aforenamed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.38. <hi>I ſpeak that which I have ſeen with my Father, ye do that which you have ſeen with your father: Ye are of your father the devil, his works ye will do: he hath been a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there was no truth in him: when he ſpeaketh a lie he ſpeaketh of his own, for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113757:12"/>verſe the 44. Sin is not of the nature of God, it is exceeding blaſphemy to ſpeak it; ſin is not of God, that is, in a reſpect to it ſelf, as it is the will of man and the devil: but ſin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods purpoſe, ordaining it for ſuch an end, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and exalt his glory, in that reſpect it is good. Now all this is not the act and will of man, nor the devil: for the will and end of God in ordaining ſin, in the being of it, and the will and end of the devil, and of man in acting of ſin, are not one but directly contrary, and in this he is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and man a ſinner, and worthy to be condemned. I will give you two or three inſtances, and many Scriptures to prove this. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. How is this a truth that God leads into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth he any man: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. Dowe not know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we are intiſed and tempted to ſin, by that ſecret luſt and concupiſcence which is in our own hearts, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all thoſe ſins againſt God, which continually we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, this is not the act of God, but the act of the devil, and of our own ſpirits, the ſpirit that is within us luſteth to envie, and by nature we do that, that we have ſeen and learned of our father the devil, continually delighting in the luſt of the fleſh, in the luſt of the eye, and in the pride of life; being inclined to all filthineſſe both in fleſh and in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. to Atheiſme, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, that there is no God: God is not in all his thoughts;</hi> or all his thoughts are, that there is no God. The ſpirit of this man cannot be God, neither is the motion of his ſpirit the act of God.</p>
               <p>Are we not often tempted to Idolatry, many times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending God to be that which he is not, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. laſt. God doth not lead a man in to this: Is there not many men that worſhip the creatures more then the Creator? <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. Is there not many that ſet up Images which are the works of mens hands, and bow down to that, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>Act</hi> 17.23. this is not the act of God.</p>
               <p>There be divers ſorts of temptations, ſome that are good for men, and others that are hurtfull and deſtructive. It is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113757:13"/>ſaid, that God leads in to temptation, becauſe he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it, and created him that is the principall Agent in it, for this one end, that the Saints might be led into it for their everlaſting joy and peace: <hi>Jam:</hi> 2.1. <hi>My brethren count it exceeding joy when ye fall into divers temptations:</hi> the devil is the principall Agent in ſome temptations, not in all, and not in any but in a way of ſubordination unto God; that, that the devil aymes at in all his temptations, is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God, yet all that he doth is ordained: there is a great difference betwixt ordaining a thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerence to its being, and the acting of the ſame thing when it hath a being.</p>
               <p>The ſins of the world are not committed by the Spirit of God, for then it would be unclean and unholy. Judge what a great blaſphemy this is, for a man to lie, ſwear by God, to ſay, God damme, refuſe and deſtroy me; and then to ſay, that all things is the act of God. God hath made a promiſe, that <hi>whoſoever ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt, he ſhall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;</hi> becauſe that men ſaid that of Chriſt, that many ſpeak now, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he had an unclean ſpirit:</hi> God cannot lie, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27.</p>
               <p>Now why ſhould the Saints rejoyce when they fall into temptation, ſhould they rejoyce when they fall into ſin, when they do break Gods Commandments, then they ſhould rejoyce in that; that is their greateſt grief and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which makes them cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am: Rom.</hi> 7.24. Again, ſecondly, if men ſhould rejoyce in ſin, then they rejoyce in that which Chriſt by his death hath freed them from; this is a contradiction, and cannot ſtand: a Chriſtian is aſhamed of nothing but ſin. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. Thirdly, if ſin bring joy to them that are in union with Chriſt, then with all ſpeed let all ſins be committed, and let all kind of filthineſſe be the continuall practiſe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, for he is to do whatſoever lies in his power for the furtherance of his joy.</p>
               <p>Therefore it cannot be ſo as thoſe do ſay, who cavill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth purpoſely to blot out the truth, and to make it appear unto all men, that it is nothing elſe but a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113757:13"/>lie and a ſhadow, and is no reall ſubſtance of divine truth as we call it, but is a meer bauble.</p>
               <p>I will ſumme up all temptations in theſe three, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by ſinning, by wounded conſcience, by all loſſes and perſecutions. Now let us in a word inquire what ſin is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a poſitive created ſubſtance, or a thing that is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative onely. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Sin is nothing elſe but an evil work which is not conformable to the Law of God. We muſt know that ſin is not the reall ſubſtance, or being of any created thing whatſoever, neither of the devil, nor men; ſin hath its privative dwelling in the heart, but it is not the heart; it is not the created power of the devil, yet it is in the devil. Now that that makes the devil to be a devil, and to be ſo denominated, and man like unto him, is nothing elſe but a want of power; for this they want, and that is their miſerie, that is, they want power to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, which is to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, and to love one another. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23, 24. The devil hath the ſame power ſtill, that he had before his fall, but not the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; ſin is not the nature of the devil, for then it may be proved, that God created ſin, and is the Author thereof; but ſin is the corruption that is in the nature of the devill, and that is the reaſon why he is ſo, and is called ſo; for his name ſignifies not his ſubſtance or nature, for that is of God, it came from God, and was created, and then it was good as all things were when they were created. Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. with the 2.3. but it ſignifies the work or action that he did, and that lamentable eſtate or condition which he is fallen into, by reaſon of that work of wickedneſſe and follie which he acted. <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. Firſt, the devil was one of thoſe Angels that God created. Secondly, the devil was one of thoſe Angels that God charged with follie; both theſe are expreſt and implyed in this Scripture: the name devil ſignifies that, by which his glorious nature was corrupted, and that condition of corruption and miſery, into which he is fallen; ſo that he cannot be no other then what he is, nor poſſibly do any other work then what he doth. The word Devil is not ſin, for God himſelf in the proceedings of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113757:14"/>his righteous Juſtice gave him ſuch a name, as was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his corrupted, fallen, condemned nature: ſin altered the nature of the devil, not in being, but in his manner of being; he was a good Angel, and in happineſſe and glory, before he had ſinned: but now he is an unhappy evil being, he is ſtill the ſame ſubſtance that he was, but he hath not the ſame manner of ſubſiſting, he is the ſame power that he was, but he hath not the ſame power that he had. Now I ſhall give you a further deſcription of ſin by theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Firſt, ſin is contrary to the Attributes of God, I ſhall ſpeak but of ſome of them: firſt, ſin is contrary to the wiſdom of God, the inventions of men is the wiſdom of the world; <hi>The wiſdom of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. The wiſdom of God is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated: But ſin, which is the wiſdom of the world, is carnall, ſenſuall, earthly and devilliſh. The wiſdom of God is that by which God himſelf knows how and in what way man might be redeemed, juſtified, and glorified; but ſin brings death, ſhame, and everlaſting ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Chapt. 2 and Chapt. 3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.1.16, 17. ſo along; where the Apoſtle ſhews what miſerie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall bondage ſin hath brought upon the whole world; and how Chriſt by his death hath freed men from this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall thraldom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſin is contrary to the power of God, the ſpirit doth make weak, poore, dying men, ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might: But ſin is the cauſe why men are weak, and miſerably poore, and it makes them to be in a continuall dying, heartleſſe condition. The power of God is that that changes the heart, and makes a perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Image of Chriſt, tranſlating him in to his kingdom. But ſin makes a man conformable to it ſelf, and ſo tranſlates the whole world into the kingdom of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Heb</hi> 9.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſin is contrary to the mercy of God; the mercy of God is ſweet, and lovely: but ſin is filthy and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>God is love.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.16. But ſin is hatred, and is at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113757:14"/>enmity with God, it cannot be ſubject to his Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Chriſt died to reconcile the perſons of men; but he never died to reconcile the ſins of men. The ſins of a Saint are as contrary to the mercy of God, as the ſins of a reprobate are.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſin is contrary to the providence of God, that doth feed and nouriſh all creatures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. But ſin is that that brings a univerſall famine upon the whole world. The power of God bears up all things, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God is that that orders all: but ſin is a univerſall faintneſſe, that diſtempers the world, and cauſeth all things to be out of order.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, ſin is contrary to the Juſtice of God, in it ſelf, and in all the righteous proceedings of it, it is juſt, holy, pure, and heavenly: but ſin is unjuſt, impure, and unholy. But I leave theſe to your meditations. Secondly, ſin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Name of God. Thirdly, ſin is contrary to the nature of God, as it is in all Saints, and in all Angels too. Fourthly, ſin is contrary to the being of God; God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a ſpirituall ſubſtance: but ſin is a meer vanity, and a ſpirituall wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, ſin is contrary to all the works of God; Ple name three of them; the work of Creation, Redemption, and Regeneration. Firſt, ſin is contrary to the work of God in the Creation; when God made all things, they were very good and beautifull: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. but ſin cauſeth all creatures to looſe that goodneſſe, beauty, and joy, that then all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had; and fils all full of ſorrow, and evill, and makes all to be ſubject to vanity. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Every creature ſuffers by the ſin of man, it cauſeth all creatures to groan and travail in pain, waiting for deliverance. But then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſin is contrary to the work of God in our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By reaſon of ſin we are heirs of hell, children of wrath, and of the devil; torment eternall, torment unexpreſſable is the puniſhment due for ſin; But Chriſt hath delivered us, he became ſin for us, he took upon him the curſe that was due to us, he ſatisfied his Fathers Juſtice, and made us who by nature were heirs of hell, and children of wrath, to be the children of God, and annexed co-heirs, together with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113757:15"/>himſelf of an immutable, immortall, incomprehenſible glory. In the work of Redemption conſider, firſt, that ſin is contrary to the coming of Chriſt. Secondly, ſin is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the life of Chriſt. Thirdly, ſin is contrary to the death of Chriſt. Fourthly, ſin is contrary to the Reſurrection. And laſtly, to the interceſſion of our Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>The laſt work that ſin is contrary to, is, our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt, ſin is contrary to the Spirit. Secondly, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the work of grace wrought in us by this Spirit; ſin is contrary to all the graces and glorious vertues of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Firſt, ſin is contrary to the faith of a Chriſtian: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the hope of a Chriſtian: thirdly, it is contrary to the love that a Chriſtian hath to God: fourthly, ſin is contrary to the grace of ſelf-deny all: fifthly, contrary to the grace of Repentance in all the parts of it: laſt of all, ſin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the grace of Mortification; it is as contrary to all theſe, to whatſoever God is in himſelf, to whatſoever he is in all creatures, by Creation, Redemption, and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as light is unto darkneſſe: ſin is not a noune ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for if there were neither men nor devils, ſin could not be, ſin doth ſubſiſt in, and is a dependance upon men and devils, ſin is not a ſubſtantiall being, but hath a being, and is upheld by theſe beings: the devil is ſins originall, the firſt riſe of it ſprung out of his ſubſtance, and he is the greateſt upholder thereof: the devil was a particular principalitie, Angel, or power before he fell, ſo he is ſtill; for when the devil had ſinned in heaven, if God ſhould have taken away the ſame power from him in reſpect of his ſubſtance when he caſt him down to hell, which before he had when he was in glory, and had not ſinned, then would he have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in his very being; and ſo he that was in the light and glory of God before could not be the ſame now; that now he is in darkneſſe. But this is againſt the Scripture, and againſt all Reaſon too: the Scripture ſaith, that thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which were once in glory, and were happy; by ſinning and leaving their habitation were moſt miſerable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and ſo came to be devils. <hi>Jude</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>So that they keep their power ſtill, but not the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113757:15"/>of power, they had power to glorifie God willingly, and with delight; now they bring glory to God, yea, but that is no thanks to them, it is not in the will of the devil, nor any defire that he hath at all by doing all that miſchief that he doth, to bring any glory to God, or good to man, if the devil did know the glorious effect, and event that many times God bringeth to paſſe by his cunning, devilliſh helliſh ſubtilty, he would do the beſt he could to avoid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abominable exploits that he takes in hand; What is the condemnation of men and devils, but becauſe the Lord is pleaſed to catch them in their own ſnare, that is, he makes their own actions to be the means of their own confuſion.</p>
               <p>They in the Gunpowder-treaſon would not have begun the Plot, had they but known the event thereof; little did the devil think when he came to our firſt parents in the form of a created Serpent, to tempt them, with many fair ſtories, curious lies, and loving expreſſions, to eat of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, that ſo he might be lord over all, that ever that action of theirs ſhould bring ſuch glory to God, as by the Almighty power of God it did.</p>
               <p>Power in God cannot increaſe nor decreaſe; but his power in his creatures hath, and ſtill doth; the leaſt Angel in heaven is greater in power then the greateſt Devil that is in hell; yet the greateſt devil that is now in hell, for any thing I know to the contrary, was the greateſt Angel that was in heaven, next unto the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>When a man hath loſt an arm or any other member, he cannot do that after which he could before: why, not onely becauſe he hath loſt a member, but alſo he hath loſt the power; the power doth not go in to thoſe members that are left to ſtrengthem them, but rather they are all made the weaker by that loſſe: you may put the member to the body, but not put life and power in to it again. Now his inward ſpirit may be one and the ſame in the power of it, not in its degree.</p>
               <p>When God doth convert a man to the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he doth put that power in to him that he never had before, ſuch a power as is divine and heavenly; for the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113757:16"/>ſpirit is the power of God; and a Chriſtian in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of converſion doth receive the Spirit of God, which changes and transforms him from the image of the devil into the likeneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Now God leads into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, that ſo he may bring light out of darkneſſe, and good out of the greateſt evil; contrary to the thoughts and expectations of men or devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now ſhall we ſin that grace may abound, God forbid:</hi> let the Lord work which way he pleaſeth according to his ſecret counſell, yet it is impoſſible that we who are once dead to ſin, ſhould live any longer therein: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, its a great temptation to be for a moment for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God; now God doth this ſometimes mediately by means, and ſometimes more immediately from himſelf; it may be God hath ordained that the devil ſhall come to a Chriſtian in this eſtate of weakneſſe, as he did to Chriſt when he was an hungry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.2. and think by ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velliſh trick or other to bring him to utter confuſion: but if God be pleaſed to work by this means ſo, as to deliver a Chriſtian in this combate from his unexpreſſable ſorrow, the devils action is nevertheleſſe devilliſh and ſinfull. So God by this means brings glory to his Name, by raiſing a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and confounding the devil.</p>
               <p>Again, Gods leads into temptation by perſecution, and to exalt his glory, and to make manifeſt his power, he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and hardens his heart for the affliction and triall of his people. Now here is an act of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and an act of God too: the act of God was to harden, the act of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was his ſeverall actions being hardened.</p>
               <p>The act of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was not the act of God, not in its ſeverall thoughts,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Theologa Germanica,</hi> he ſaith, that ſin is a great torment to God, that he wouldwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death that it might be extinguiſh ed. pa 87.</note> purpoſes and inclinations; did God think as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought, and were Gods purpoſes and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> both one and the ſame, and was the Almighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and reſolved to make war with himſelf, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was? and did God lay that puniſhment, and theſe ſeven grievous plagues upon himſelf, and upon his own Spirit, which he laid upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all Aegypt? and was God ſenſible, or did he feel that grief, pain, and torment which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113757:16"/>he felt, or that, that our ſpirits feels often in many condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſickneſſe, fears, ſorrows, paſſions, and extremities, that we know to be true; now all things cannot be the act of God.</p>
               <p>Again, when God requires and commands me to yeeld obedience to him, to repent, and beleeve the Goſpel, and to forſake my ſelf, and this world; to look up to him for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; to prepare for death, affliction and judgement; who doth he ſpeak to, to himſelf all this while?</p>
               <p>Again, God doth not rule all things in all reſpects; there are many rulers under and beſides God; the Devil is a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, a governour, and there are many rulers under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Again, man is a Ruler, and there are many Rulers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der man; The <hi>Pope</hi> is a great Ruler, and he holds up his kingdom for the Devil: <hi>Antichriſt</hi> among the <hi>Familiſts</hi> is a mightie Ruler, a ſubtle politick one, he rules by the power of the Devil, by all his doctrines, miracles, and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.13. but he is not grown ſo great yet. Again, there are many Rulers under men; the King under an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and many Rulers under a King; ſome are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſome Heathens: God doth not rule all things, nor act all things.</p>
               <p>When a man reſolveth to kill or rob ſuch a perſon, and all his thoughts run upon it, and he cannot reſt untill it be done; when he doth it, is this the act of God? If this were true, there could be no order nor government in the world.

               <head>CHAP. IIII. <hi>The third Errour, which is, that nothing ſhall remain eternally but the eſſence, life, or Spirit of God, which is now in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: The contrary is proved both by Scripture and Reaſon. And three Errours more nominated, but handled in order.</hi> Hebr. 1.10, 11, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25.</head>
               <p>I Shall open this Errour thus: the bodies of men ſhall turn to duſt, or to what it was before; if it was nothing, it ſhall turn to nothing. But they ſay, that it was hid potentially in God, and ſo it ſhall return into ſilence with God again. There is no created thing whatſoever ſhall continue; if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were created within thoſe ſix dayes in which God did make and finiſh his work, they alſo ſhall periſh, and come to nothing; but thoſe ſpirits that we call good and evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they call good or evil motions of mans minde.</p>
               <p>The Confutation.</p>
               <p>I do not know any truth that is either expreſſed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this Errour, either according to Scripture or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; if there were I ſhould be willing to plead and contend for it. I ſhall include three Doctrines or Errours in this one, and ſet them down in order, and ſo open and diſcover them to you; The 4. Errour is this.</p>
               <p>That the Scriptures are a confuſed Allegory, a meer ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a falſe hiſtory, and ought not to be any mans founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more then any other book, or the Apocrypha.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they deny the coming, dying, Reſurrection, Aſcention, and Interceſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that all Ordinances are but meat for babes; that a man ſhould live above them without the uſe of them. Now the firſt of theſe which includes the reſt, I ſhall prove is againſt the Scriptures, and againſt Reaſon too.</p>
               <p>I ſhall divide the third Doctrine into two branches; firſt, if nothing but the Godhead ſhall remain or continue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; then it is plain, that the Godhead or eſſence is in every creature. Secondly, that nothing but God ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113757:17"/>to eternity; this firſt branch of. this myſticall Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme, I have already oppoſed, by ſuch plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Reaſons, as none that have any deſire to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth can willingly deny: yet becauſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make ſure work as I go, for the profit and comfort of all thoſe who do in truth love and acknowledge the Lord Jeſus; I ſhall bruiſe the firſt head with the whole Errour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by theſe poſitive concluſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the preſent univerſall frame and ſtate of all things in this world ſhall not remain to eternity; here is two things to be inquired into, and they are theſe. Firſt, what is the preſent eſtate or univerſall frame of all things in this world. Secondly, how ſhall it be proved that this world ſhall not continue in the nature, being, and courſe of it by the multiplications of ages to all eternity. I le diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the preſent eſtate of this world under theſe ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this world in reſpect of the univerſall compoſall of all things, is ordained and created for to continue for a ſet time, and not to be eternall in its generation: <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17.66.22. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.1. This world hath had many alterations and changes in it ſince the creation; we know it to be true both by Scripture, Revelation, and Reaſon too: all theſe have and do ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto us, the mortality, mutability, and inſufficiency of this world. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.34. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Job</hi> 5.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.10. The glory of this world in all things hath been one and the ſame for the matter and manner to all perſons in all ages; it is not an increaſing glory, it hath no new thing to ſhew us; it hath no after depth of ſweetneſſe to empty or powre forth in to our boſomes, in any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or any more then what it hath already diſcovered unto our Fathers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath promiſed, that out of the ruine, and by the deſtruction of this old world, he will raiſe up a new one, a world that ſhall be full of glory; a new creation that ſhall be full of righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neſſe and peace, in another manner then ever it hath been in this world. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20. &amp; 66.9.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:113757:18"/>
               <p>Thirdly, the whole world at this preſent lies under a bondage of corruption; and is altogether ſubject to vanity. <hi>Vanity of vanities, ſaith the Preacher, all is vanitie.</hi> Eccleſ. 1.2. The greateſt glory of this world is nothing elſe but an earthly vanity, Again, it is not onely vanity, but its alſo ſubject to it: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the conſtant waiting and preſent deſire of this creation, is for a Revelation and diſcovery of a Chriſtians glory, which will be to them alſo a day of joy and freedom from all corruption and vanity: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.21. The day when the King comes to his Crown is a day of liberty and freedom to poore priſoners and captives; the glory of God ſhall be ſo ſtampt in a higher, ſublime, divine degree then ever, upon the ſubjects of that kingdom; that it ſhall be a great comfort and refreſhment to all creatures, I mean to all that are ordained, to all thoſe to whom God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the preſent condition of this creation, is a poore, dying, conſuming condition: <hi>Job</hi> 15.15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.15. Chap. 1.7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. laſt. Care not for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for the morrow ſhall care for it ſelf, the day hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with his own grief; this we all know by our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, unleſſe we will deny that that is as plainly to be underſtood as that the Sun is in the firmament.</p>

               </head>
               <p>COnfider of the truth and ſufficiencie of the Scriptures, by theſe following confiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if the truth of God were ſuch a thing, as that it might be underſtood, and ſpiritually apprehended by fleſh
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113757:18"/>and blood, by humane reaſon, which is not Divine but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe God; then is it poſſible for darkneſſe to comprehend light, and to be united too and made one therewith. But the firſt is impoſſible, and therfore the laſt: for St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that there is no fellowſhip between light and darkneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15. between righteouſneſſe and unrighteouſnes, Chriſt and Belial: now if there be no fellowſhip, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and agreement between God and the Devil, Chriſt and Antichriſt, ſin and grace, how is it poſſible for fleſh and blood to know or underſtand the minde of the Spirit? And although many ſay, that all things are gathered up into one fulneſſe, as the rivers by returning are gathered into the Sea; yet the contrary is daily made manifeſt to us, by thoſe direct oppoſitions which we ſee between the hearts of men, and betwixt their lives too, there is no truth in this, namely, that the infiniteneſſe of God gathers up all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into it ſelf, as the Sea gathers up all Rivers: and I prove it thus. Firſt, when the Rivers by returns are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in to the Sea, they are made one with it; whileſt they were, they might be diſtinguiſhed; but now they are not as they were, all diſtinctions are annihilated; every ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by running into the Sea is made one ocean, and one wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together with it. For if it were poſſible for a man that knows all things to look upon the Sea, and in that to ſee and know what the waters were; if he could diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the waters in the Sea, which ever hath been the Sea originally, and thoſe waters which are Sea, by being in the Sea, and of the ſame element, but before were Rivers, he would acknowledge that all creatures are not thus gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into, and made one with God; for then all creatures by being gathered up by one fulneſſe, in to one which is God, then ſhould all creatures by being thus gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one fulneſſe with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is no truth in this, becauſe there is no truth neither in grace nor nature that will or can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this, (for) all Rivers that are ſwallowed up by the fulneſſe of the Sea, were, before they were thus gathered, one element together with it. But all creatures are not of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113757:19"/>one and the ſame nature, or divine ſpirituall ſubſtance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with God; therefore its impoſſible that ever all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould thus be gathered up in too, and by being thus gathered ſhould become one fulneſſe with God. If this were true, then, as ſome affirm, every thing were the word of God, and ſo the knowledge of every thing, and of any thing whatſoever, were the onely knowledge of the Word of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. that no man knoweth the things of a man, but the ſpirit that is within him: ſo no man knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God. It is impoſſible for that light that is belowe God, to know that light which is God. No man can know the light of the Sun by the light of a candle; the light of Reaſon is but Moon or candle light, it is too dark, weak, and wateriſh to diſcover the light of the Sun by it; nothing belowe God can diſcover any thing of God: but all creatures in all reſpects, conſider them as creatures, are belowe God; conſidering of God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to himſelf: therefore all creatures cannot diſcover God, nor thus be made one with him.</p>
               <p>Again, whatſoever is infinite, to that nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but God was the ſame fulnes before the creature was, that he is, now the creature is, therefore no creature, nor all creatures can not be ſo gathered up in to God, as to be made one fulneſſe with God, who is not, nor cannot be no other now, now all creatures are, then he was eternally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any creature had a being.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if a carnall ſpirit could underſtand the minde of God in the Word, then could it no longer continue to be a Chriſtians center; that that flows from Chriſt, to that Chriſt muſt be a center. But all Chriſtianity flows from Chriſt, therefore it muſt needs be centered in him.</p>
               <p>Now if the written Word could be known in the letter, and in the ſpirit, by one who hath not the ſpirit, then dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would be turned into light, and light into darkneſſe; the Word of God would then be not heavenly but earthly: But as nothing can change the being of God into that which is not God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. though many ſeek to do it; So
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113757:19"/>nothing can change the Word of truth into that that is not truth, that is, into a lie, this the power of men and devils ſhall never accompliſh. If the Word of truth in the letter, and in the ſpirit, could be diſcerned by a lie, then conſider what a great loſſe all the people of God would then have, and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Word of God is the foundation that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath or ever ſhall have to all eternity: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Chriſt is a Chriſtians foundation in theſe foure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Firſt, the foundation of our election, this the letter declares; and as that declares it, ſo we know it, and are able to prove it. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. A Chriſtian was choſen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, in Jeſus Chriſt from eternity, Chriſt is the Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. the Word bears up all things, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians election is born up, and kept from being aboliſhed, by the glorious perſon of our Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt is the foundation of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption too: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.9.18. He was the Lambe ſlain from the foundation of the world, and he is that perſon alſo, conſider of him in his Godhead, that ordained, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part himſelf to be a ſacrifice and an atonement for the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is the foundation of a Chriſtians conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is the foundation of a Chriſtians everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Perſwade me if you can who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you are, that would race and blot out the Goſpel of Chriſt both in the letter, and ſpirit, that I have no other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Redeemer, Governor, and Creator, then that ſpirit which is within thee, which thou didſt receive in the wombe; and then I ſhall beleeve this that you have ſaid concerning the Scripture: therefore to conſider you as you in truth are, the more you ſpeak againſt the Word of God, the more cauſe I have to beleeve it, for the devil will never ſpeak well of Chriſt, unleſſe it be for ſome devilliſh end or other. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Thirdly, no man ever would write ſuch a word that is ſo much againſt him, and altogether contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him, as the two teſtimonies of our Lord Jeſus are, for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113757:20"/>then man would make a law againſt himſelf, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Law and Reaſon. Who is the man that will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, and betray himſelf to death through his own accuſation; man inſtead of making ſpirituall Laws, is the onely breaker of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. and 3.10, 11. Doth not our daily practiſes continually declare the truth of this unto us? But ſome will object, that I do all this while prove the Word to be true from it ſelf, which is a contrary thing, and gives no ſatisfaction at all. To this I anſwer. That I do thus I acknowledge, and that for this Reaſon: Becauſe I have no other way to prove the truth, that it is true, but by the truth. No man can know the Sun that is the Sun, but by the light thereof. Secondly, the teſtimonie of the Word is of it ſelf a ſufficient teſtimony for it ſelf: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, Word, and Spirit, and theſe three are one:</hi> they are one God, one Spirit, one Truth, and one Teſtimony. The Lord ſaith, that there is no other God beſides me, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.6. Now by the ſame rule men may ſay, how ſhall we know thee to be the true God, we have no witneſſe or teſtimony but thy own. I anſwer. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and teſtimony which God bears of himſelf is true, and ſufficient, becauſe he doth not onely ſay that he is God, and ſo leave men there, but he acts according to his Word, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth an Almighty power, cauſing men to acknowledge him, to be in truth that he is, and cauſing all creatures to diſcover and reveal his power and Godhead to the world. A man may ſay that he is God, as many do, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove what they ſay; for their ſaying that they are ſo, doth not cauſe them to be ſo, unleſſe they could come forth with an infinite Almighty power to act as God doth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Whatſoever is beſides the Word in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Word is not a truth but a lie, and then what is it beſides the truth that can come in, really to iuſtifie and bear record to the truth.</note> the teſtimony of the truth is a ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for it ſelf, becauſe there is no other truth beſides it. The Word in the Spirit bears witneſſe to the truth of the Word in the letter; and the truth of the letter bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to it ſelf in the ſpirit: the letter in it ſelf is dead, but the Spirit of that truth which is in the letter, quickneth and giveth life: The bare letter is but a Hiſtory, or a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it is a true relation. For the Apoſtle ſaith, that no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113757:20"/>lie is of the truth, there is no lie in the truth, conſider it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the letter, or in the ſpirit. We know that there are many lies caſt upon the truth by him who is the father of lies; but conſider of truth in it ſelf, and no lie can be any part thereof: for the Word doth imply this, it could not be thus denominated, if its nature were not according to its name. The term light, ſignifies the nature of light; ſo the Name of God, ſignifies the nature of God; ſo the word truth ſignifies the nature of it: the name of truth is truth, and ſo is the nature of it too.</p>
               <p>Now conſider that nothing is ſo contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nature and internall diſpoſition of man as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is: the Word of God is contrary to all the principles of follie that are in the hearts of men. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God:</hi> this was a ſecret ſpirituall wickedneſſe that lay lurking in his heart, he was a cunning fool, he thought in his heart as the <hi>Familiſts</hi> do, that that he would not often confeſſe with his tongue, and although he loved this Atheiſticall religion well, yet he was not very willing to ſuffer for it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that I ſhall draw from this firſt verſe is this; that the wiſeſt man in the world is a meer fool untill he be a Saint, untill he leaves the wiſdom of the world, and thoſe poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick logicall doctrines which that wiſdom teacheth, and be filled with the wiſdom of God. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. that the doctrines and words of mans wiſdom makes the croſſe of Chriſt of no effect. Chap. 1.17. The word of God, the doctrine of a crucified Jeſus is meer fooliſhneſſe to them, it is too holy, too plain and ſimple for them to deal with; if they ſhould teach the truth as it is in Jeſus, and not mix their own words and corrupt imaginations therewith; if they would declare the whole truth, and keep back no part of Gods counſell; what then, why then their perfection muſt fall down to the ground. Therefore you ſee how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Word of God is, to all the principles of mens hearts, and contrary to all their practiſes too. What will not, what doth not many men do, who are taken to be great Preachers of Chriſt, I ſay, what will they not do, to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113757:21"/>exalt Babel, to prefer their own bellies and outward eſtates, before the Word of God, they take it up in their Sermons, in the ſight of the people, but lay it aſide in their lives and converſations.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, no man could ever parallel any other book or writing to this Word of God; but in all ages, for all ſorts of perſons, it hath been, in one reſpect or other, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Writings, Councils, and Diſputations: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is or hath been under heaven concerning Religion, there is but one truth, as there is but one God, which in the power and ſpirit of it is God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. Chap. 5.32.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Scripture is written for this end, that it may be an occaſion of offence, and a ſtone of ſtumbling both to the Jews and Grecians, and by this means their eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and to others a ſavour of life to eternall life. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23, 24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. There is no writing that ever hath been beſides this, that hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch life and power, by which it hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, and caſt down, ſaved, and deſtroyed, as this Word of God hath: No word hath been ſuch a diſcovery of the minde of the inviſible immortall God unto men, as this Word of God hath. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>Again, what writing hath diſcovered the nature and condition that all men by nature are in, unto men in ſuch a manner as the Word of God hath: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. which proves, that it was written by that Spirit that knows all hearts, and all things: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. Reaſon it ſelf tels us, that it is impoſſible for any power to change the carnall, ſtony, lofty ſpirit of man, but that power that is above all things, and can do all things. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.17, 18, 19, 20. Chriſt by doing that which the Scriptures do declare to us, did open that ſealed book, which none would undertake, but the Lambe ſlain from the beginning of the world. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. The Apoſtle ſaith, that the Word of God is lively, and mightie in operation, ſharper then any two edged ſword, and entreth through, even to the dividing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder of the ſoul, and the ſpirit, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.12. Some do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113757:21"/>and ask what is here meant by this clauſe, ſoul and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, being that they are both taken for one and the ſame in Scripture. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.46, 47. <hi>Mary</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſoul magnifieth the Lord, and my ſpirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>There are two interpretations upon this Scripture: the firſt is, that the ſoul of a man is not the ſpirit of him, but it is his body in which his ſpirit is, and from which it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. And to prove this, there are theſe Scriptures: <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt ſaith, that his heart did rejoyce, and his fleſh did reſt in hope, becauſe thou wilt not leave my ſoul in the grave. Now how can this be, ſay they, that the ſoul of Chriſt ſhould be left there where it never was, if it be not the body it implyes that it was there, and if ſo then it muſt needs be mortall. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9, 10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p>A ſecond interpretation is, that by ſoul is meant the heart and ſpirit of a carnall man; and by ſpirit is meant one that is regenerate: To which they bring this Scripture, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. Now take it which way you will, this muſt be granted, that the Bible is the Word of God, becauſe theſe arguments are drawn from it; and if there be any truth in either or both of them, then is the Scripture that declares them a truth alſo.</p>
               <p>The Word of God is powerfull in two reſpects: firſt, it is powerfull in it ſelf, and ſo it is the fulneſſe or God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is powerfull in all its operations in reſpect of it ſelf, it is infinite, the operations and workings of it is mightie, as it is in the creature; look upon the hearts and lives of thoſe that have been ungodly, and abominable, ſee what a change there is, all this doth declare the truth of the Word. O what a fin it is for you that have been ſuch, and have been changed by the Word, ſo to fall away from God, as to deny his Word: Juſt as if I ſhould deal by a man that had often ventured his life to ſave mine, and to requite his love, I ſhould adventure my life unjuſtly, and without cauſe, to take away his. The life of a friend ought to be very dear unto me, but the truth of God more dearer. The Word of God is the life and glory of the Lord Jeſus, the cauſe of life in every Chriſtian is the life that is in Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113757:22"/>I live, ſaith our Saviour, ye ſhall live alſo: then how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and lamentable a thing is it for a man that knows this life to crucifie and make a mock of it, the ſecret thoughts and intents of all hearts are diſcerned, and made manifeſt by the Word of God: <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.25. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the whole Scripture is given by the inſpiration of God. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. this is expounded by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. where he ſaith, that no prophecie of Scripture is of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interpretation, that is, it is not the writings of men, conſider them as men, the Prophets and Apoſtles that writ the Scriptures, did not write down their own private medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; for the prophecie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Spirit, that is, they ſpake by the inſpiration of God, by a Spirit that was infallible, and could not lie. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. But ſome may ſay, that though they were infallible in writing, yet they were no more then you are, for you ſay that you are infallible alſo. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, ſo far as I cleave cloſe to this truth, and do not derogate in the leaſt, ſo far I am infallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But how do you know when you write ſuch and ſuch truths, that you do not in the leaſt meaſure adde to, nor diminiſh from the Word of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> When I write from ſuch as need no interpretation I am then infallible. And that there are ſuch Scriptures, I prove, 3 <hi>Job.</hi> 16.17.27.31. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. ſo on. This is a truth that I write, and an infallible one, that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, it is Chriſt that is dead, yea or rather that is riſen again, who fitteth at the right hand of God, and maketh requeſt for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Another is, that there is but one God, but one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and not two. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4. Again, that every man ſhall be raiſed up with his own body: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.38. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32. to receive a reward according to his works. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. That perfection of ſpirit and body cannot be obtained in this life: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. with many others of the like nature. Now when I write this, and ſay that I am infallible, it is not my word, nor another particular infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113757:22"/>truth beſides the Scripture, but I write the ſame truth which was written by the inſpiration of God: I know that I write infallibly, becauſe I write the infallible truth; and I know the infallible truth by the light of that Word that I write from both, in the letter, and in the Spirit. I know there are many nice curious queſtions abroad, which are not worth the anſwering, becauſe they do not tend to edifying; for if a man, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. would give heed to them, they would be endleſſe, and to no purpoſe, but to ſtir men up to contention, and vain jangling.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, there is no book whatſoever that is ſo full of truth, and ſo free from errour and contradiction within it ſelf, as this Word of God is, although the eye of ſence and reaſon cannot ſee it: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. All the writings of men are ſubordinate to this, and all the truth that is in all creatures did flow from this, and is a dependance upon this. Now I prove this by theſe arguments: that that is a divine truth, cannot contradict itſelf, for then God would be divided, and light would be at enmity with it ſelf: but the Scripture was written by a divine Spirit, and ſo muſt needs be a ſpirituall truth, and therefore free from all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and errour within it ſelf. Secondly, that that by one Almighty power, cauſeth all to be holy and ſpirituall, that in it ſelf muſt needs be ſo; for it is impoſſible but that the ſtream ſhould be according to the fountain, and every effect according to its originall: But the Word of God when it changeth the heart, cauſeth all the parts of it ſo far as it works to be holy and ſpirituall; therefore in it ſelf it can be no other then according to its workings. The Word of God is the originall cauſe and fountain of all holineſſe: <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. all that infinite holineſſe and purity which are in, and flow from, men and Angels, are but as ſo many ſtreams flowing from this fountain.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh reaſon to prove the truth and ſufficiency of the Scriptures is this: becauſe no word hath inabled poore ſimple illiterate men to underſtand the minde of God, and to ſuffer reproaches and perſecutions in the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as this Word of God hath. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:113757:23"/>6.7. <hi>He'r</hi> 11. whole Chapter. The letter onely cannot do it, the letter is no help to the Spirit, for the Spirit is the ſame truth that is revealed in the letter, and was before it, and now is no more then it was; for the letter doth not adde to the Spirit, but is onely a relation which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely uſefull to man, and without which nothing can be; But the Word in the Spirit is the ſame truth which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main when the letter ſhall be aboliſhed. Many times when men could not enjoy the Bible, they have been enabled by the powerfull injoyment of the Word in the ſpirit to ſuffer in the defence of the Word.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, they that do deny the Word, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding do make the Scriptures to be the ground of all their Sermons and writings: now if their Sermons and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have any truth in them, and they draw that truth from the Word, then the word muſt be a truth alſo; for it is as impoſſible for them to draw a truth from the Word, if the Word were not the truth, as it is for any man to draw a reall ſubſtance from that which is but a meer ſhadow. The mad mans divinity is called the myſtery of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet he will not acknowledge that to be a truth, all his writing will ſufficiently prove that there is little of the Word of God to be ſeen in it, being nothing elſe but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded confuſion of Logick, Philoſophy, and Aſtrology altogether, which in truth is no better then Familiſticall Atheiſme: and although they father theſe confuſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies upon the Word, yet the Word of God doth remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely pure in it ſelf without mixture, and ſo will continue for ever.</p>

Chap. 26.74. the 11.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24, 25. Chap. 9.55. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.3. but his coming in the Spirit is, not onely to be with us, but to be within us too: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. Chap. 12.41. God laid our chaſtiſements and griefs upon him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5.9. God did this out of love to Chriſt, and to the world; neither Jeſus Chriſt nor a Chriſtian ſhould ever have been ſo exalted and glorified in ſuch a meaſure and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they are, had not Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9.29.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt did lay down, and nail to his Croſſe, all that glory which he had in the fleſh, and under the Law, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the glory which he formerly in the time of the Law in all his appearances, gave to the Fathers, and then raiſed up the ſame again in a greater, brighter, livelier manner then ever it was in the world before. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8. That, that was the greateſt glory of God in Sion before Chriſt, is now by his coming and dying turned into the greateſt obſcuritie and darkneſſe, as God did by <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in taking away his life, that it might be reſtored again to him; which thing ſhould be a wonder, and a miracle to all that ſhould hear it: God took away the life of Chriſt, and all the glory that did depend thereon, that ſo in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, miraculous way, he might give a better and a higher degree of life and glory both to him, and to all his, to the admiration of all things both in heaven and earth, then ever they had before; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. Chap. 2.17.28.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:113757:24"/>
               <p>Secondly, to prove it by the light of Reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, if Chriſt be not dead, yea or rather is riſen again: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. I ſay, if he have not died for ſin, then ſhall we never die to ſin, but be for ever dead towards God, and our Lord Jeſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there be no death of Chriſt, then there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any reſurrection of life either to himſelf, or to any creature. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.43.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Errour I will now take in <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no reſurrection nor laſt judgement for the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if there be no death, no life, or reſurrection at all, then is there no God at all, there is none of theſe but in this way; he that denyes one, denyes all; he that denyes the Son who is begotten, denyes the Father who doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. and 2.22, 23. <hi>Whoſoever denieth the Son, the ſame hath not the Father;</hi> for the Son in reference to his eſſence or Godhead is the Father, Chap. 5.1.20.21.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">See the <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> It may be truly ſaid, that this book and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is no other but the gate of heaven, and the houſe of God: and though in this paſſion he made darkneſſe his pavilion, nevertheleſſe as his darkneſſe, ſo alſo his light, pag 185. li 9 ſoon Chriſt crucified at Ieruſalem is imaginar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, but in man, in one that is deified, there he may be ſeen really crucified; this is notable iugling.</note> he that denies Chriſt, and hath no other way to acknowledge God by that Reaſon, that is flatly contrary to his very nature and being; theſe are two direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which cannot be reconciled by all the humane wiſdom and policie in this world. For if there be no other God, nor no other nature, eſſence, and Divine motion, then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their deſcription, then by the ſame rule I'le prove that there is no God at all. Again,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if all this were true, then there cannot be any ſin in the world; and if no ſin, then no need of a Saviour: for God did never make a breach in himſelf, nor ever was at enmity with himſelf, neither is it poſſible that he ever ſhould be capable of Redemption.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if this were true, then is all preaching vain, and faith is alſo vain, and we are yet in our ſins, and all they that are aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, if this were true, then of all men religions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113757:24"/>and opinions in the world, we who have no other life and glory, no other God or ſalvation but what our hope rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches forth unto, we ſhould of all men be the moſt miſerable, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. But here is our comfort, and everlaſting joy, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. that ſince <hi>by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men would perſwade us that bread is ſtones, and ſtones bread; and why, but becauſe they conceit it to be ſo; but if they had no other bread or meat then ſtones to eat for a moneth together, I beleeve they would be of another minde, and would find as well in the things of God as men, that a conceit or imagination doth not alter the nature or being of any thing; but becauſe it is what it is in it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; therefore it ought to be ſo known and apprehended of all men.</p>
               <p>Eightly, if there be no reſurrection, nor laſt judgement for the world, let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die; this doore is wide enough to let in all whoriſh filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prophaneneſſe, all ſins of all ſorts and degrees whatſoever; its no matter how men live, what they ſay or do, or how they die, there is no account to be given for any thing, if you ſhould conceit that all the goods that I have, or any other man, to be thine, by this reckoning it were ſo, ſo by that means we ſhould be ſtarved, unleſſe thou wouldſt have mercy on us: if this be love, the Lord Jeſus keep me, and all his, from being of ſuch a Familie.

               <p>The reſurrection of Chriſt, and of the dead,
<note place="margin">See the <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> That reall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering which we taſte in our ſelves, preſents a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Image of the paſſion of Chriſt, then that which hovers in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: and that, that we feel inwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The light of Reaſon that God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113757:25"/>hath ſet up in the hearts of men, is very uſefull, neceſſarie, and commendable; all the while that it keeps it ſelf within its own compaſſe and center: but when once it begins to make any attempt for the finding out, apprehending and diſcerning of that which is not within its reach, it then comes to be loſt and deſtroyed, a man by this light cannot diſcern the things that be of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p>The light of Reaſon is the wiſdom and glory of this world: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. and the wiſdom and glory of this world is darkneſſe and fooliſhneſſe with God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19, 20. A Familiſt is in this like unto a Papiſt, who ſaith, that the Popes unwritten verities are of equall value with the Word of God, ſo ſay they; that the outgoings of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in them, are the outgoings of God in his higheſt and greateſt glory. Now the concluſions of their Reaſon, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, theologicall and heavenly; this is the myſtery of Divinity, the reall divine ſubſtance, the true light, and the perfect, infinite, and onely good; the Bible is a ſhadow, a confuſion, and a meer lie; and all that ever any man can ſay from thence, and all that which they themſelves have ſaid formerly which is contrary to their judgements now, this is ſo alſo a reall ſhadow, a lie, a lowe light, and vanity.</p>
               <p>For how is it poſſible, ſay they, that ever there ſhould be any reſurrection either of Chriſt or the dead? how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that that blood which was trampled upon, and ſpilt under the feet of the Jews, ſhould be by the power of God gathered up again, and put into the body of our Saviour. A ſecond objection is this: How can any man prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, when men are ſo ſcattered and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by death, ſometimes men are drowned, and ſo become food to many hundred of creatures that are in the ſea, and thoſe are afterward eaten by men, and thoſe men conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by creatures again; and ſo many thouſand times over one creature is devoured by another: now how is it poſſible that theſe men ſhould ever receive the ſame bodies again that are thus deſtroyed, and conſumed?</p>
               <p>Theſe Objections are not worth the anſwering; yet if I ſhould not ſpeak ſomething to them in particular, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113757:25"/>would ſay that they were ſuch divine myſteries, that we could not tell what to ſay to them: a fool may put forth ſuch a queſtion, and cauſe more trouble to come thereby, then ſeven wiſe men that can render a reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now the Reſurrection is ſuch a thing, as that it cannot be received by any for a truth, but ſuch as have the truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made manifeſt in their ſpirits, by the power of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit that raiſed up the Lord Jeſus: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. Now that which I have to ſay is this; <hi>O fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened except it die; and that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be; but bare corn as it falleth of wheat or ſome other: but God giveth it a body at his pleaſure, to every ſeed his own body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou wilt but look upon this world in its creation and generation, thou mayeſt continually in the large book thereof read many excellent ſtories of the Reſurrection: is not the world in its creation as wonderful in many reſpects as it is in its Reſurrection? Doeſt thou beleeve that man was made of the duſt of the earth? conſider of the work of God in that reſpect, and what was the duſt made of; we ſay of nothing. Thou ſayeſt that of nothing can come nothing. Then it muſt needs be of the eſſence of God; for nothing is without beginning but God: that, I think, you will grant. Is God ſuch a being as that any thing can be made of him? Did God make all things of himſelf? Is the eſſence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded? the bodies of men and all creatures are. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the infinite, immutable, and unmoveable Godhead to be divided? but men are, divided in their limbes and lives too, yea, divided in all things, in his Spirit, and in moſt of the imployments and out-goings thereof; what work is it that the heart of man can undertake to manage in all reſpects without diviſion? how are the ſpirits of ſome men ſet at diſtance from others, by reaſon of pride, malice, hatred, and envie? Do not you yourſelves ſometimes meet with ſome kinde of men that are of ſuch a ſpirit as this is, that would be glad to ſee you ſtoned, murthered, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? And would not they themſelves, if it might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, quietly be your executioners? Now what is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113757:26"/>and bodies of theſe men made of? is it eternall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning? is it a being of it ſelf, and doth it perform all its actions by its own power? Is this the true God, and is there no other Gods beſides it? If this Spirit be God, then what is that ſpirit or life that thou haſt within thee; that is God too: ſo then there is but one God which is one in all creatures. Now if life be one and the ſame in all creatures in this ſence that now we ſpeak of, then tell me one thing: Is not the tree in the root and fruit thereof both one and the ſame? is it poſſible for a corrupt fountain at one and the ſame time to ſend forth ſweet waters and bitter? Doth not the words and works of a mans heart continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the frame thereof? Now how comes it to paſſe, if God be one and the ſame in all ſpirits, that there is ſuch a vaſte difference between them; if they be all one and the ſame power, good, life, and glory? how then comes in thoſe mightie differences, contradictions, and direct oppoſitions that are amongſt them; if every creature be a branch, or an out-going of divine glory, then is it not poſſible that it ſhould in the leaſt meaſure be contrary to its originall; and ſo there could not be any of that unhumane crueltie, that unreaſonable oppreſſion, thoſe grievous bloudy wars and ſlaughters, that doth produce ſo many ſorrows, and cauſe ſo many ſpirits to droop, and lie a languiſhing as do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: this is not the bodies of men, for that without the ſpirit is dead, that doth cauſe and act all this. When a mans life is gone, all wounds, griefs, and pains are nothing to him, he feels them not; it is his ſpirit that makes him ſencible, and active either for the obtaining of joy, or for the avoiding of fear and torment. If the ſpirit be God, and the body or outward orgin made of his eſſence, how then can all this be, I know no reaſon that you can have to maintain any Argument, or to raiſe up any objection by.</p>
               <p>True Reaſon is able to vindicate it ſelf againſt it ſelf, when its light is put out; and againſt Reaſon turned into darkneſſe: now when Reaſon is thus divided, it is like a man that is diſtracted; Reaſon is a ſervant to man in the ſpirit of him. Now there is a power in man that is above
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113757:26"/>Reaſon, and thorow this power Reaſon many times comes to be captivated and enthralled: Reaſon in it ſelf, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its own affairs, is without contradiction; Now when once it come to be oppoſed by the heart of man, ſo that it cannot any longer rule and prevail, it leaves its habitation: and when once it comes to be void, of that which before it took much delight in, and gave continuall entertainment to, then it comes to paſſe that a man loſeth himſelf, and all that glorious ſweetneſſe and conſolation that did depend thereon.</p>
               <p>When a man hath a Counſellour to be his guide in all his weightie imployments, ſo long as he hearkens to him, and is ruled by him, he may flouriſh and proſper: But if once he thorow his own conceit and imagination come to forſake the light and glory of that Reaſon by which he was guided, he then comes to be loſt and deſtroyed. Now the reſurrection of the dead, though it be above reaſon, and againſt it, as it is ordered and managed by the hearts of unreaſonable men, yet it hath more reaſon of its ſide then it hath againſt it: for whatſoever is a truth in the light of grace, is not a lie in the light of reaſon; for grace in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall gives being to reaſon, and it doth not give being to it for this purpoſe, that by its light and ſtrength it ſhall darken and put out the glory of the Lord Jeſus. For then that Proverb would be true which is common among us, That we have nouriſhed and brought up a childe to pluck out our own eyes.</p>
               <p>Now conſider, that the reſurrection of Chriſt, is the cauſe why the dead are raiſed, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. and if Chriſt be not riſen, then the dead ſhall never be raiſed: But now is Chriſt riſen, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept;
<note place="margin">See the <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> pa. 198. where he ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt is within us, it follows where he is to be adored in our ſelves, and it is more excellent to ſee him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in our ſelves, then at Ieruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their own thoughts and writings is all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they have to prove this by, I am certain they can have none out of the Bible.</note> there was never ſuch a reſurrection as the reſurrection of our Saviour was; many were raiſed up again, but not to life for ever, to live and return to the grave again.

I will further prove the reſurrection of Chriſt, by the Scripture, by the light of the Spirit within me: and thirdly, by the continuall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and heavie perſecutions of the Saints without me in all ages. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. what myſtery is there in theſe expreſſions, are not theſe ſufficient witneſſes, and of more authoritie then vain imaginations?</p>
               <p>This is one of the Articles of my faith, to beleeve that the Bible is the Word of God, and is of more Authoritie then all words and writings whatſoever.

               <p>The Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt hath humbled, renewed, and brought down to the earth the ſtouteſt, and proudeſt loftieſt ſpirit that ever hath been in this world: them that have been forward for the devill, them that have been reſolute, that would venter life and all for Antichriſt; even them God hath changed, and of theſe that never men had any hope of, hath God taken and made the greateſt inſtruments of his glory.

               <p>Secondly, the greateſt degree of light and glory that ever roſe or ſprung up in the hearts of men in this world, was produced by, and onely iſſued forth, out of the glorious Croſſe of our Lord Jeſus. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.8, 9, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.46, 47. <hi>verſe</hi> 41.44. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9.10, 11, 13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.

<note place="margin">See the <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> he that cleaves to this man, cleaves to God, ſo he that imbraces this paſſion, injoyes the higheſt good. pag. 242.

               <p>There was two Gods that met at the Croſſe of the Lord Jeſus, the God of heaven, and the god of this world; the battell was begun as ſoon as ever the promiſe was made: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and the devil many times grew ſo ſtrong in force and power, that many times to the eye of man, there could be little or no appearance of the glory of God, which in every reſpect was but darkneſſe, to that glory which God revealed by the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, at which time the devil made full account to conquer; the devil then drew all his forces together, and never made ſuch a bold attempt in any age upon any perſon, as he did at that time upon the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt: and had he but found any thing at all in the leaſt meaſure in Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo he might have had an opportunity, and have found ſome footing for his temptation, he then had overthrown him, and God for ever. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. ſo to the 10.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, I prove the reſurrection of Chriſt, by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering torments, and hard uſage that the Saints have ever had, and ſtill have, for acknowledging and contending for a crucified Jeſus, and the reſurrection. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.7. and 5.17, 18. The Sadduces were as great mockers and haters of the Apoſtles as the high Prieſts were, yet they were contrary in judgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.6. Chap. 21.31. and 17.32. The Sadduces and the Familiſts are alike in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:113757:28"/>
               <p>In denying the Reſurrection, in holding forth but one Spirit, and in mocking and jeering at the Apoſtles for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſt. In this reſpect I prove this by two or three Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.27. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.8. Chap. 17.32.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is a truth that Chriſt aſcended with the ſame body in which he ſuffered; I'le prove it by Scripture and Reaſon. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.51. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>Job.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. You ſay, that nothing aſcended but what firſt deſcended. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That the humane nature of our Lord Jeſus in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects never deſcended from God out of heaven no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the whole Creation did; yet there is an unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible difference between the creation of Chriſt and the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the humanity of Chriſt did not at all deſcend from heaven in reference to it ſelf, but in reſpect of its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; and ſo in ſome reſpects the whole Creation deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for God in the Creation did deſcend down into a lowe diſguiſed appearance, in the form and appearance of every creature, and the outward form of every creature is a reall appearance of God. But more of this anon. Now I'le prove that Chriſt in reference to his conception and creation, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſcended before he aſcended, in reference to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as I ſaid before: he deſcended, and made forth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall manifeſtation of himſelf unto the world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. Now the Reaſons why Chriſt never deſcended, in that reſpect before named, are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there was nothing in heaven before all things but that being that is eternall, without beginning; but the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt was not in reference to it ſelf eternall, without beginning, and without end: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not in heaven. For nothing can deſcend from heaven that hath not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect a real being in heaven; Now in this reſpect Chriſt had not, and therefore he cannot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt aſcended that he might be clothed with that glory which before he had not; but the Divinity is an infinite glory, and therefore it could not aſcend up to that,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113757:29"/>that it was it ſelf from all eternity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the eſſence is infinite in power, at all times fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all places with its preſence. Now to ſay that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity aſcended, is to ſpeak a contradiction, and plain non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: for what ſhould it aſcend to, to it ſelf? it is alwayes one and the ſame glory, and alwayes alike in reference to it ſelf in all places. Therefore if they hold no other Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then this, they hold none at all, as in truth they do not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Jeſus Chriſt aſcended up on high, that he might fill his humanity, and all things elſe both in heaven and earth, full of glory. Now further to prove the falſhood of this Doctrine, namely, that nothing aſcended but what firſt deſcended, conſider this: the infinite glory of God was never increaſed but onely manifeſted, by the reſurrection and aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt aſcended, not that he might fill his Godhead full of glory, for that is infinite, but all things elſe that were ordained, and prepared for glory from all eternity in our Lord Jeſus. Even for this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt aſcended up on high, that he might fill all things full of glory by the manifeſtation thereof, who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to have a ſhare in his death and reſurrection: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10. &amp; 2.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. laſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10, 11. The joy and glory of Chriſt and a Chriſtian doth depend upon the reſurrection: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. The Spirit had never deſcended into the heart of a Chriſtian, if Chriſt had not aſcended into glory.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, concerning the interceſſion of Chriſt, wherein conſider: that the purpoſe of God from eternity to beſtow Chriſt upon, and manifeſt him in all Saints and Angels, was not in any other way but through the interceſſion of our Lord Jeſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2, 3. and 17.19. and 14.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. the concluſion.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt aſcended up to heaven that he might ſend the Spirit; and when that had finiſhed its work on earth, that he might again deſcend at the laſt day for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and damnation of the whole world, in the appearance of the power and glory of his Father. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:113757:29"/>
               <p>I know, and do expect nothing from the hands of many, but that many reproaches, mockings, and ſlanders ſhall continually fall upon me, from them: I deſire not to ſpeak out of malice or envie to any perſon whatſoever, I appeal to him that knows all hearts. The thing that I plead for, is for the truth, againſt the opinion of Antichriſt.</p>

VII. <hi>Myſticall Antichriſt deſcribed, and confuted in his ſixth Errour, proving, that the Ordinances of God are abſolutely uſefull to all Chriſtians whatſoever whileſt they have a being in this world, they being the worſhip and ſervice of God, commanded and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved both by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, the Saints in their higheſt eſtate of ſtrength and glory, whileſt they have had a being in this world, have ever lived in the uſe of all Gods Ordinances. I ſhall give you theſe Scriptures, and theſe three inſtances to prove it. Firſt, the Son of God himſelf made it his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practiſe to walk in the uſe of his Fathers ordinances, I will name three of them: The Ordinance of Preaching, Baptiſme, and Prayer. Firſt, our Saviour did walk in the uſe of the ordinances of Baptiſme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. Secondly, he commanded his diſciples both to Preach, and practiſe it too, as he had done before them: <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment they conſtantly obeyed, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. So as that no perſecution whatſoever could take them off from it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.23, 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ordinance of Preaching the Goſpel, was the act and work of our Lord Jeſus from the wombe to the grave, either in his own perſon, or in the perſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.4, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. The ordinance of Baptiſme is neceſſary, and ought to be practiſed, ſo it be in a Goſpel way, to a Goſpel end, by a Goſpel Adminiſtratour: <hi>Act.</hi> 8.31.38, 39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. But the ordinance of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of abſolute neceſſitie, and a work that God hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in all ages to the converting and increaſing of his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113757:30"/>Church and people: Baptiſme, and other ordinances are ſubordinate to this; this is the higheſt and greateſt of all. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. Others are que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, and diſputable, men know not hardly who is in the right, whether for Infants, or beleevers, or for neither as they are inſtituted. But concerning the other, God hath raiſed up famous Inſtruments of his glory, even of both parties, by preaching the Goſpel, which none can deny: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the chiefeſt buſineſſe which he had to do, and for which principally he received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for, was not to baptiſe, but to preach the Goſpel. See <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Epiſtle 1.4.13.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the ordinance of Prayer was the continuall practiſe of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. and 11.41, 42. and of all the Apoſtles too, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. Now I appeal to all Saints, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the higheſt and ſweeteſt communion that ever they have been made capable of in this world, hath not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by, and in the uſe of, theſe two ordinances, in the preaching of the Goſpel, and in ſpirituall Prayer and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
               <p>Again, the ordinances of God is the worſhip and ſervice of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42.46, 47. in and by which they have fellowſhip and communion with God. Now if a man ought to live above the ordinances, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and continuall practiſes of thoſe who are deified and immutable, then a man ought to live in fellowſhip and communion with God, without worſhipping, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſerving of him. So then according to this, darkneſſe and light are both in one, by being one; light is darkneſſe, and darkneſſe is light, that is, ſin is in grace, and grace is ſin; the holineſſe and purity of the moſt holy and bleſſed Spirit, is the unholineſſe, blaſphemy, and abominable fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of the devil, and man: and the abominable filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men and devils is the act of the holy Spirit of God; yea, it is the divine and immortall glory of this Spirit, and the Lord Jeſus. O horrible blaſphemy! that ever any ſhould preſume to ſay, that all the motions and actions of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whatſoever, are the motions and cut-goings of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113757:30"/>bleſſed God. This is a truth, that the motions and actings of the Spirit, is the divine and immortall glory of God in the ſpirits both of Saints and Angels, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſee the non-ſence and contradiction of this: if the life and ſpirit of man and all creatures be God in his eſſence, then all creatures in all conditions whatſoever ſtand in need of nothing. I prove it by this argument: Whereſoever the eſſentiall power and glory of God is, there is ſuch a perfect fulneſſe, ſo that there can be nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. Chap. 14, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25. But the life and ſpirit of man, and all creatures, is God in his eſſentiall power and glory: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there can be no want of any thing in any, or in all creatures. Now all ordinances muſt needs be uſeleſſe, and to no purpoſes; a man muſt preach and pray with the underſtanding, or elſe he doth act like a fool. Now the underſtanding of man is the ſoul of man; and the foul or ſpirit of man is a purer underſtanding, and this is one with truth, and this truth is eſſentially God. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all this, is this, that the ſoul of man is God. Now if the eſſence of the ſoul be the underſtanding, one with truth eſſentially God; then man ſtands in need of the uſe of no ordinance, he is now paſt learning, or rather paſt grace, he is not an Infant now, he ſtands not in need of milk; what need a man regard the beam that is in the Sun? to what purpoſe ſhould a man run after the ſtreame, who is the fountain? Now if the underſtanding or ſpirit of man be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially truth, as God is, then man hath all things, and can do all things; and neither preaching, hearing, nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can adde any thing to him that is perfect, who hath all things, and is in want of nothing. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25. Now if the ſpirit of man be God, as they often affirm, then he muſt, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, without all controverſie,
<note place="margin">See the book, intituled, <hi>Theologa Germanica.</hi> pag. 37.</note> have the fulneſſe of the Godhead with him: but I think that none will openly ſay this, nor anſwer to this; and all that they have or can ſay in preaching, private diſputing, or writing is nothing elſe but cunning Sophiſtery, devilliſh Philoſophie, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a proud, ſelfiſh, vain imagination.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, a man ought to live above the ordinances in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113757:31"/>many reſpects, in the lawfull uſe of them, but in no reſpect without uſing them ſo long as they may be injoyed: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. ſo on: <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. No man ought to aſcribe that to an ordinance which belongs not to it, they are but creatures, and ſo a man is to uſe them, as that by them, they being by God ſet up as the means, to bring men to God who is the end. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.21. God is pleaſed to convince, to convert, confirm, refreſh, and revive the drouping ſouls of his Saints, by them in the uſe of them. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. yet ſo as not to live upon them, but upon Chriſt who is in them, and above them. Now for any man to caſt aſide the ordinances of God, as things of no uſe, for him that is ſtrong as well as he that is weak, he goes on in a way that is no better then enmity and rebellion againſt Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</hi> They are not friends, but enemies and rebels, who out of wilfulneſſe or ignorance do practiſe the contrary; <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. Conſider theſe two things: firſt, for a man to live in the uſe of the Ordinance by the light of Reaſon, and of the Word in the letter, this is to live belowe that light that he ought to live in: See both theſe in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2, 3, 4 ſo on. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18, 19, 20, 21. A man may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the light of the Word and Reaſon, be an enemy to the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. See the ſame Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, for one that is truly ſpirituall to live upon Chriſt in the uſe of ſome, and not in the uſe of all, which thing is poſſible, and too often practiſed; a Chriſtian may walk ſpirituall in one, and legall in another: a Church may walk orderly in ſome things, not in all. Now ſo far as a Chriſtian is not ſpirituall, ſo far he is condemnable, and walks in that action contrary to the principle of divine light that is within him: a Chriſtian can expect no leſſe, then to receive, againſt all actions that are not iſſued forth, or do not flow from a principle of light, even from him who is eternall life in all Saints, cauſing them to fix their eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great point of eternity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>The ſeventh Errour divided into two branches: the firſt handled in this Chapter by way of queſtion, Whether perfection in the higheſt degree, both of grace and glory be attainable in this life, yea or no.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis muſt needs be true if the reſt be, but I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt it, and that is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, where perfection is, there can be no addition or increaſing either in one part or other; perfection hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above it, nothing under it, nothing about it, I mean in reference to it ſelf, that wanteth any thing; if there be any thing wanting, then it is not perfection: But the beſt of men here in this world have not at all times, and in all things that which they do deſire, or at leaſt what they ſtand in need of: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no perfection to be injoyed here. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15.18. Now I reaſon of it not as tis in it ſelf, which is the God head, but as it is in and injoyed by the creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the eſtate of perfection, there ſhall be no bringing of the ſoul under clouds of ſin and darkneſſe, as it is here whileſt in this body of ſin and death, nor no bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body under clods of earth which requires a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but all this befals us and all men here, therfore here is no perfection. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21.23, 24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the eſtate of perfection the whole body of Sion ſhall meet together in glory. I'le prove the argument thus: The Saints, not before one another, but altogether, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their portion of glorious perfection: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. From theſe Scriptures I draw theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, neither <hi>Enoch</hi> nor <hi>Elias</hi> which were tranſlated, and were not, for God took them, yet theſe have not, neither ſhall have their full portion of divine glory, till all the Saints do meet in the unity of faith, and that acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the race and courſe of a Chriſtian ſhall be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113757:32"/>finiſhed in reſpect of faith and obedience, ſo that he ſhall not have any work of this nature to do or finiſh when he comes to heaven, even ſo ſaith the Spirit, what is that? <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the dead that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God hath ordained, that all theſe weakneſſes, temptations, corruption and obſcurities ſhould befall the Saints here, that ſo heaven and glory may be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heavenly, and out of meaſure glorious to them. Bread is more ſweeter to the hungry, then to him that hath his fill of it every day. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2, 3. Chap. 8.18. The King who is above all men, cannot think it ſuch a high and glorious condition to be a King, as he doth who is a begger: all the afflictions of this world, although they are one of the greateſt glories that a Chriſtian hath here, yet it is not worthy to be compared to that glory that ſhall be given and ſhewed to them in heaven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if any man ever had perfection in this life, then that perſon injoyed a greater priviledge then ever the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or any other eminent Saint have enjoyed ſince the Creation. <hi>Paul</hi> had it not, nor none elſe that can be thought of, but do ſtay till we all meet: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. laſt: it is the will of God, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the time when they ſhall enjoy this, ſhall be at the glorious appearance of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the eſtate of perfection a man ſhall have no enemies, neither death, nor devill, nor a deceitfull unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving heart, nor any perſon to reproach, backbite, or be any trouble to his ſpirit: here a man cannot be free from them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> here is no perfection. Again,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in that eſtate of joy unſpeakable, and full of glory, a Chriſtian ſhall not onely ſee himſelf thus changed by the power of God, from the likeneſſe of him in his grace here, to a higher degree of glory hereafter; but he fees all creatures both in heaven and earth thus changed alſo: he ſees the whole Creation that is now under the bondage of corruption, freed from this imperfection: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And God
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:113757:32"/>hath promiſed ſo to diſcover himſelf by the teachings of the Spirit unto the elect, that all ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian ſhall not ſee God obſcurely, but perfectly in every creature; they ſhall ſee God in his naked glory as he is in himſelf, and in all creatures: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. yea they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall appear with God in that glory, in which they ſhall have communion and converſe together in to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. Then ſhall every Chriſtian be perfect in the glory of Chriſt, when he ſhall have reſigned up his office and kingdom of his Mediatorſhip to God his Father, that God may be all in all, and above all. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. But all this is not here, therefore here is no perfection.</p>
               <p>When a Chriſtian ſhall be clothed with perfect glory, he no longer is a doing, but a praifing God for what he hath done for him, and for all the Saints and Angels which are in heaven; and for what he hath done to all creatures in all places, either in light or darkneſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be for the condemnation of him who in the fleſh was his own father: thy Name, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> is fearfull in praiſes. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Chap. 14.3. and 5.8. to the end.</p>
               <p>If they can diſprove this, then perfection is in this life; this is true, that the reſt and glory that a Chriſtian hath here, is the ſame that he ſhall enjoy to all eternity: a man in Chriſt here, and Chriſt will be his reſt, and heaven his perfection and joy for ever. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. and 17.21. Yet this is not manifeſted too, nor enjoyed by the Saints whileſt they are here, not in that perfect fulneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency which they ſhall live in and enjoy hereafter. As they are all here in one body helps to one another, by way of adminiſtration for their edification; ſo ſhall they all meet together in one body without diviſion, at the time of their glorification, of which Chriſt ſhall be the head. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
               <p>The humanity of a Chriſtian in heaven ſhall not be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane but divine, not earthly but heavenly. Our Saviour ſaith, that they ſhall be as the Angels of God in heaven:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113757:33"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29, 30. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.25. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the body of a Chriſtian is ſown in corruption, and is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſown in diſhonour, and is raiſed in glory: ſown in weakneſſe, and is raiſed in power; it is ſown a naturall body, and is raiſed a ſpirituall: it is firſt a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, then afterwards that which is ſpirituall. And as we have born the image of the earthly, ſo ſhall we bear the Image of the heavenly. For corruption, that is, fleſh and blood which is in an eſtate of weakneſſe whileſt it is here, in this mortall ſinfull condition, cannot inherit the kingdom of God. He doth not ſay, that the ſpirit of a Chriſtian is in perfection in this life; neither doth he ſay, that at the laſt day the ſpirit ſhall be glorified without the body, but he ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> the 51, 52, 53, 54. <hi>Behold I ſhew you a ſecret thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> viz. <hi>we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed.</hi> There ſhall be ſome Saints, if not all, alive at the coming of Chriſt, and they ſhall be tranſlated as <hi>Enoch</hi> was, though in a fuller and perfecter manner.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle doth plainly prove, that, that body which before was weak, mortall, and diſhonourable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was no longer before then a moment, or the wtinkling of an eye, yet it ſhall be made ſpirituall, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and immortall. Mark what he ſaith, and it will be clearly manifeſt, that perfection of ſpirit and body is not untill the laſt day. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever you are that light of this book, I pray you ſeriouſly to read and conſider, all thoſe Scriptures that I have quoted; it is not my judgement and opinion that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to plead for onely, but more eſpecially for the truth of the Goſpel.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:113757:34"/>and Writings of the learned Fathers, doth confirm and teſtifie; take this diſtinction to this Rule, and that is this, that all the power of God, under all conſiderations is not in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nature, or beeing of God; I ſhall clear up this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by ſpeaking of the power of God, under the ſecond noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſider of the power of God in two reſpects, as it is in all his works, by Creation, by Regeneration, concerning the power of God in the creatures, in reference to the Creation; take this rule that the (eſſentiall power of God creating) in all creatures created, conſider of it wholly in a reſpect to the Creator, and it is in the nature, eſſence and beeing of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.26. and ſo that power is abſolutely and eſſentially God, now to this rule take this diſtinction, that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated power in all creatures, that in many reſpects is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as well as Gods, is created, and then is ruled and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in its beeing, by that infinite power which did create it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3 powers and all creatures muſt needs ceaſe to bee, if they were not preſerved by that power, that is Infinite: but God doth not give ſpirit or power to any creature, that by that hee may come to bee eſſentially in the creature, and ſo by being eſſentially there, the creature may come to bee eſſentially God, I diſtinguiſh between the power of God creating, and the power of God created: God gives power to the creature, by cauſing it to bee, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it when it hath a beeing; that power comes from God, yet it is not God, it is but a creature, it is not the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; now conſider it in reference to its originall, and it is in the beeing of God, but conſider it in reference to it ſelf, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, created, limitted beeing, that had a beginning, that is not eternall, and it is not in the nature of God, neither is it the eſſence of him; it is true, that all things doe live, move, and have a beeing in God, but how, every thing doth not live, move, and have a beeing, in the nature and eſſence of God, for there is nothing in the eſſence, that is not the eſſence, but all creatures are not in the eſſence, therefore all creatures are not God.</p>
               <p>All things doe live, move and have a beeing in the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and diſcoveries of God, all the manifeſtations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113757:34"/>of God are God, not God in his eſſence, but God in that diſcovery.</p>
               <p>All creatures doe live, move, and have a beeing in the Sun, that is, they live and move in the appearance and diſcovery of it, they live not in its eſſence, if any creature had a reall beeing in the eſſence of the Sun, it would then loſe its beeing, it muſt needs loſe its name, and its nature too, it muſt ceaſe from its beeing, and could bee no longer called light but darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>So if it were poſſible for any creature to live, move, and have a beeing in the nature and eſſence of God, God would then loſe his name of being God, and the nature of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head too; if any can prove the creature thus to bee, God muſt then ceaſe to bee, and all the eſſentiall and infinite glory of the Lord Jeſus, muſt needs bee turned into obſcurity and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>We cannot divide betwixt the eſſence of God, and God in his appearance, but we muſt diſtinguiſh between them, wee cannot divide the heat from the fire, nor the beam from the Sun, but wee diſtinguiſh, but it is neceſſary to make out the higheſt Truth, by its own light, I think that is the onely way not to undervalue it, but to reveale and declare it.</p>
               <p>In the Trinity, the Father is not the Son, yet he is in the Son, it is not God divided, but diſtinguiſhed into three perſons, the three perſons confider them diſtinct, are a threefold appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God. But conſider of them in their God-head, and they are all one God eſſentially, ſo that one perſon, or all the perſons in the Trinity, conſider them diſtinctly as perſons, and they are really God, yet, but God in an incomprehenſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; the perſon of God the Father, is not the Godhead of the Father, ſo the perſon of the Son, is not the eſſence of the Son, nor the perſon of the bleſſed Spirit, is not the Spirit in its eſſence, if you will not acknowledge this, you deny the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, the Word of God to a ſpirituall eye doth plainly diſcover this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17. Let us a little open and ſeriouſly conſider this Scripture, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I will pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hee ſhall give you another Comforter, that ſhall abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, but yee know
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113757:35"/>him, for hee dwelleth with you, and ſhall bee in you.</hi> In the firſt part of the 16 verſ. which is, <hi>I will pray to the Father,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe foure things: firſt, the perſon praying; ſecondly, the perſon of God the Father, which our Saviour prayed to; thirdly, the thing; fourthly, the perſons he prayed for; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt, the perſon praying, here will ariſe theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, firſt, whether the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, God and man, that is the nature of God, and the nature of man, both meeting in and making up one perſon, did put up this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſupplication to God the Father; Secondly, whether Jeſus Chriſt not in his perſon, but with his ſpirit and body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſpirituall in the firſt Inſtant of creation, ſuch a ſpirit and body for matter as all men have, ſin only excepted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this did pray to God the Father yea, or no; thirdly, and laſt of all, whether Jeſus Chriſt prayed to the Father in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his being the Word, yea, or no; now to all theſe I give this Anſwer, that it was Jeſus Chriſt God and man, that prayed to God the Father.</p>
               <p>The union of natures in the perſon of Chriſt is ſuch, the like whereof is not to be found no where, neither in heaven nor in earth; yet the union of natures in the perſon of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, are not one without diſtinction, they are not confounded, nor converted into another, ſo as to bee one and the ſame in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>The Word is the divine, and is not the humane; the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane is the humane, and not the Divine; take it thus, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature in Jeſus Chriſt, is not the ſecond perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity without the humane.</p>
               <p>The humane, a compleat ſpirit and body, as <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other had, which was in Chriſt, is not a perſon without the divine Nature; See St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Chriſtoſtom, Eraſmus, Roterodimus, Euſebius,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sybbs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton;</hi> all ſorts of learned Writers, doe expreſſe this, that both natures doe goe to the making and compleating of the glorious perſon of the Lord Jeſus, and although they are one perſon, yet they remaine intirely and perfectly two natures, both in his ſuffering ſtate, and now in his glorified ſtate, the glorified body of our Saviour, doth really remain in one place,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113757:35"/>and is not every where, the divine nature is not limitted, but is at once in all places, yet the principall ſeat of it is the ſoule and body of Chriſt glorified in heaven, it is no where as it is there, the divine nature of Chriſt is in the humane, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane is made divine and heavenly by participation, the divine nature is not comprehended in the humane, that is made divine immortall, perfect, and heavenly, for Chriſt, as the word is in all the Elect, both Angels and men, in reference to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, he is in ſome reſpects in all creatures. <hi>Joh,</hi> 17. <hi>ult. Gal.</hi> 2.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Job</hi> 34.13, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29, 30, 31. Chap. 6.26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is in all Chriſtians, and all Chriſtians are in Jeſus Chriſt, that is, as he is the word, and by the ſpirit he is in a Chriſtian; the humane nature is not in any one, nor in all Chriſtians, nor any Chriſtian is not in the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt, it is true, God is made manifeſt in the fleſh, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is in our natures, and our natures the humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt is in two natures, ſo is a Chriſtian too, in the ſame natures that Chriſt is in, the humane and divine nature that is in a Chriſtian, is in the humane and divine nature of Chriſt, but it is not the ſame in all reſpects that Chriſts is.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath took upon him the nature of man, and he is now in this, and will be ſo for ever, my nature is in Chriſt, but how? in two reſpects, in a reſpect to our creation, and ſo all men are in that nature that Chriſt is in in this reſpect, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. the lumpe was one that all mankinde was made of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. One man depends upon another and all upon God, and ſo generations comes to be, all men are one in reference to their originall the earth, but in their diſtinct formes they are many and not one; all men is not one man, though of one man and one blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.39. yet they are not all one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor ſpirit, there are ſo many diſtinct bodies and ſpirits, which every particular man hath, and not another.</p>
               <p>Secondly the humane nature of Chriſt and a Chriſtian are both one by union, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. now you ſee how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane nature of Chriſt is in a Chriſtian, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and divine nature of a Chriſtian is in Chriſt too, here is a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:113757:36"/>great unexpreſſible union, but yet a diſtinction too, I am not the perſon of Chriſt, the perſon of Chriſt is not mine, for any man to ſpeak this as the Familiſts doe, it is to ſpeak a meer Phantiſie, and acknowledge no Chriſt at all nor God neither, but what is within him: now to Anſwer to the queſtions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, there was foure ſorts of actions acted by Chriſt, the action of his divine, and the actions of his humane nature, not in any way of diviſion or ſeparation, but in a way of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thirdly, the actings of both natures in one perſon; laſt of all, the actings of Chriſt in his God-head or eſſence. Now this was not the act of his God-head, for then the eſſence ſhould make ſupplication to it ſelfe, which is a contradiction, for duties proper to man, which God commanded, and Chriſt obſerved, are not proper to God, neither is God capable of duty or ſervice, neither doth hee ſtand in need of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was not the act of Chriſt the Word alone, for this was a part of Chriſts Mediatorſhip to intercede with the Father for the Saints, for the comming down of the ſpirit: Thirdly, it was not the act of Chriſt man, without the word, for that was not able to undertake any thing in the work of Redemption for man without the help of the Word, Spirit, and Father, but I apprehend it was the act of Chriſt, God and man the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, to intercede with God the Father the firſt in the Trinity, that hee would ſend down the Spirit the third perſon, to be a Comforter to them and in them, all this doth diſcover the power of God to you.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is the perſon of God, which the perſon of our Saviour prayed to, God is a Father to Chriſt in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the divine nature, the Word, was begotten of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds, he was begotten of God, of the nature of God, and was ever with the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. Secondly, he is a Father to Chriſt in reference to his humane nature too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.1. Jeſus Chriſt in reference to both natures had but one Father which is God, now Chriſt as God the Word, begotten of the Father from eternity, as man created in the fulneſſe of time, now as God and man both in one perſon, comming forth from God, did, whilſt in the world about the work of his Mediatorſhip pray unto God. I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113757:36"/>will give you one inſtance, and ſome Scriptures to prove this nſtance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. <hi>And now glorifie thou mee with thy owne ſelfe, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was,</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son,</hi> thy Son how, glorifie the humane nature without the divine? no, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. And ſecondly, as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, all ſpirits and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoever are ſubordinate and ſubject to the perſon of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.21, 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that he ſhould give eternall life, to as many as thou haſt given him, God gave power to Chriſt, to give eternall life and glory to all thoſe whom he had before elected and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Jeſus Chriſt, from all eternity to have a ſhare in his death and reſurrection, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. Laſt of all he hath power over all fleſh, <hi>Hee hath the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion, Pſal.</hi> 2.8. But all fleſh is not ſaved by the croſſe of the Lord Jeſus; <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a red of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in peeces like a Potters veſſell.</hi>

                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father, glorifie thou mee, with that co-eternall unlimited glory, which I had with thee before the world was:</hi> to all this take this Rule, that God never decreed before all time, to doe any thing in time, but what was from eternity ſeated, and ordained to be, by the glorious perſon of our Lord Jeſus, that is, all the decrees of God concerning the accompliſhing of all things from everlaſting to everlaſting, were, as in one glorious Roll, writen with Letters of Gold, ſet down by the finger of the ſpirit, of the eternall immortall God, from all eternity, in the glorious perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23, 24, to the 32 the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, ever had a poſſeſſion of all the Decrees, Purpoſes, and Counſels of God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The glory of the divine nature was, that it was from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity united to the humane, and the glory of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was, that it was from eternity, and in the fulneſſe of time actually united to the divine nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Chap.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113757:37"/>1.6. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 97.7. thus both in one, did receive glory from God, as if he had ſaid, now I am united to the humane nature, and both natures the divine and humane met in one; having done that work which thou gaveſt me to doe, glorifie my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with ſuch a glory even the ſame <hi>that I had with thee before the world was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the thing that our Saviour prayed for was for the comming down of the Spirit, not unto, but alſo into the hearts of the Saints. I ſhall Anſwer one queſtion, and that is this, whether the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus deſcended in its perſon, or in its eſſence, yea or no?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The eſſence of the Spirit is the God-head, which was the Creator and great manager of all things before Chriſt came in the fleſh, <hi>Job</hi> 26.12, 13. when the Spirit came, it came to performe the work or office of a perſon, which was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale and diſcover God in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h.</hi> 16.13 14. to and in thoſe whom God had ordained to be partakers of ſuch a glory. Laſt of all the perſons which our Saviour prayed for, was firſt, for his Diſciples, ſecondly, for all the Elect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20. I conclude with this, the bleſſed Trinity are alwayes acting in and for the perſon of a Chriſtian, the Sonne he prayes, and ſuffers too, the Father he heares the Son, and ſends him into the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. the Father and the Son doe ſend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the work of the Spirit being ſent, is to dwell with, and in the hearts of the Elect, the other verſe is, <hi>And hee ſhall ſend another Comforter;</hi> another beſides Jeſus Chriſt, this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>hee [him]</hi> proves the Spirit to bee a perſon, <hi>And hee ſhall ſend,</hi> here is the perſon of God, and the act of God; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God in the firſt part, <hi>And hee ſhall ſend,</hi> meaning the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the act of God, <hi>Hee ſhall ſend the Comforter, that hee may abide with you for ever.</hi> In the laſt part of the 16. and in the 17 Verſe, you may ſee the perſon of the Spirit, and the action of that perſon the perſon of the bleſſed Spirit, I prove by foure words: <hi>The world ſeeth [him] not, neither knoweth [him] but yee know [him] for [hee] dwelleth with you.</hi> Then here is the action of the Spirit in theſe two expreſſions, <hi>to dwell with the Saints, to dwell in them too,</hi> not to dwell with them as a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with the Wife, but to dwell with them as the ſpirit with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113757:37"/>the body, ſo to dwell with them and in them, as that they and it ſhould be both one ſpirit in God.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing that I ſhall obſerve is this, our Saviour did take occaſion to open and illuſtrate the glorious comming and working of the Spirit in the Diſciples, by its being a ſtranger to the world, and the world a ſtranger to it; as if he ſhould ſay, I will out of my free love and grace to you, as I have in your natures dyed for you to redeem you, ſend the Spirit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale the excellency of my Death, Perſon, and Reſurrection to you, by that ſpirit that the world cannot receive, the world hath no heart nor minde to receive him; our Saviour gives two Reaſons for this, firſt, <hi>Becauſe it ſees him not;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>it knows him not.</hi> Now ſee what an excellent and glorious thing it is, for to ſee and know the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and this I have ſpoken concerning the firſt Attribute, the power of God, which the world knew not, nor ſaw not, and why? becauſe it was not with them and in them. I ſhall now be briefe in ſpeaking of the reſt of Gods Attributes, having already diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them all in this.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Attribute that I ſhall ſpeak of, is the Wiſdome of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. this is that by which alſo God doth all things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>The Lord by Wiſdome hath founded the Earth: by underſtanding hath hee oſtabliſhed the Heavens. By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</hi> The Wiſdome of God is abſolutely and eſſentially God, <hi>Job</hi> 11.7, 8. Chap. 12.16. Chap. 23.6. Chap. 25.11, 12, 13, 14. Chap. 28.12, 13, 14. here is in theſe Scriptures a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſcription of the Wiſdome of God, and when you read theſe, conſider of the infinite glory of your Saviours perſon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.36, 37.</p>
               <p>The third Attribute is the Mercy of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. Chap. 4.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. 32, 33, 34, 35. From this obſerve theſe things: firſt, there is a greater manifeſtation of the Wiſdome and Power of God, in the Mercy that he ſhews to man through Jeſus Chriſt, then there is in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all creatures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the eternall love and mercy of God in the Lord
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113757:38"/>Jeſus, is the cauſe of the eternall being, and eternall well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both of Men and Angels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16, 17. The immortall, inviſible, and incomprehenſible glory and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of both, is conceived in, and brought forth out of the wombe of the free grace and mercy of God; the free grace and mercy of God is the light of his countenance, lifted up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſon of a Chriſtian, in the perſon of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. The free grace and mercy of God, conſider of it, as it is in it ſelf, is the Majeſty and eſſentiall glory of the Lord Jeſus, the Majeſty and eſſentiall glory of Jeſus Chriſt, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and eſſentially God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32, 33. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21.22, 23, 24. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>The fourth Attribute is the Juſtice or Righteouſneſſe of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Job</hi> 34.10, 11, 12, 23. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Conſider of the Righteouſneſſe of God in two reſpects, in Chriſt, and in men, from hence I draw theſe concluſions; firſt, all that unexpreſſible wrath and miſery which God laid upon Jeſus Chriſt for the ſins of the world, was an unſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtation of Gods Juſtice and Righteouſſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the everlaſting death and perpetuall miſery of the whole world, is another excellent diſcovery of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. the Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is the nature and being of him, for God is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite being of divine holineſſe, the nature and beeing of God, is abſolutely and eſſentially God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29.</p>
               <p>The fifth Attribute is the preſence of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23, 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9. before I ſpeak of the preſence of God, here are theſe queſtions that will ariſe; firſt, what difference is there between the preſence of God and the nature of God? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether Gods preſence is, where his eſſence is not? Now for Anſwer to the firſt: Conſider of the preſence of God in a twofold reſpect, firſt, there is the preſence of God, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Omne-preſence; Firſt, conſider of the preſence of God, now to open this I ſhall take theſe Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.25. the ſecond Scripture is this, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That whereſoever two or three are met together in my name, there will I bee in the middeſt among them.</hi> Jer. 23.23. <hi>Am I a God at hand,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113757:38"/>the Lord, <hi>and not a God afarre off? Pſal.</hi> 139.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. There is the preſence of God, and the ſpeciall preſence, from theſe Scriptures I draw thus much; firſt, every creature doth injoy the preſence of God, I ſay injoy, that is, the joy and glory of every creature, is the preſence of God with and in that creature, I mean all but them that are in torment; take it thus, whatſoever any creature is, hath, or ever ſhall have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of, the cauſe and continuance of that creature, is the preſence of God with that creature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.27. God doth not feed, cloathe, and preſerve all creatures without his being preſent with them, doth God doe any thing for any creature, and yet is not preſent with and in that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is preſent with no creature in ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, as hee is with thoſe that are elected, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. <hi>I in them, and thou in mee:</hi> A Chriſtian doth injoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, <hi>I in them,</hi> as Chriſt injoyes the preſence of the Father, <hi>Thou in mee,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt dwels in a Chriſtian, and God dwels in Jeſus Chriſt; God is preſent with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and ſo he is with the damned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.8. for it is not poſſible that ever he and them, ſhould ſubſiſt in eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by dying, yet never dead, conſuming, yet never conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but muſt periſh and ceaſe to bee, were it not that God doth uphold, and cauſe them to ſubſiſt by the power of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; hell and death it ſelf would not bee, were it not born up, and upheld by this power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. my diſtinction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſence of God with the creature, is cleare and plain, I will a little further illuſtrate it. It is true, God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with thoſe that are in hell, but not after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net as he is in heaven; God is preſent with the damned, but that is not any cauſe of joy to them, but it is their torment, it were better for thoſe poore wretched creatures, by a thouſand degrees, yea, ten thouſand, if they had not the preſence of God at all with them, for then their torments would end, and they would be at reſt, it would bee an unexpreſſible happineſſe to them if this might bee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.24. God is preſent there, but not as a Father, there hee is in the power of his wrath, a Judge, a conſuming fire there, think of this all yee that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113757:39"/>and blaſpheme God, God is there, and the Devill ſees him together with the damned, but Gods diſcovery is in a way of obſcurity and darkneſſe, the ſame God is in heaven, filling all with joy unſpeakeable and full of glory, and he doth manifeſt himſelfe, not as a Judge but a Father of mercy and God of all conſolation, not in a way of obſcurity, but in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. yea, in the glory of his Godhead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Wee ſhall ſee God, as hee is,</hi> now the preſence of God with any one creature, and the preſence of God with all creatures, in reference to the creation, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their damnation, is not the eſſentiall nature and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine beeing of God eſſentially, God is preſent with thoſe that are in hell, that is, he is preſent by his Juſtice, and the Juſtice or righteous vengeance of God, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. that is, there is the nature of God, that is, it is not the eſſentiall nature, for that is infinite, and cannot be circumprized or comprehended in any place, now reckon, how much of the juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God there is in hell, and there is juſt ſo much of his nature there, but no creature can comprehend either the one or the other, and although the juſtice of God, as it is in hell, cannot be comprehended, neither by them nor all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet, as it is there, it is not infinite, and ſo not God eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; I will give you two or three inſtances, God the Father is preſent in the perſon of Chriſt, the nature of God is in the glorious perſon of our Saviour. Now wee muſt apprehend, that though the nature of God, be in an unexpreſſible meaſure in the perſon of Chriſt, yet conſider of that nature in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Chriſt as a perſon, and that divine nature in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſon, is not the nature of God eſſentially, the perſon of Chriſt is not the godhead, but a perſon ſubſiſting in the godhead.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance is this, grace and glory, is the nature of God, now this nature is in a Chriſtian, for the Spirit of God, Jeſus Chriſt, and God himſelf dwels in him, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:113757:39"/>preſence is his being, Gods being is a ſpirituall Divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, now whereſoever God is (there his preſence is, and where his preſence is, there his nature is, we cannot devide betwixt the nature, and preſence of God, but we diſtinguiſh concerning them, Gods preſence in Reference to it ſelfe, is his nature eſſentially, but not in reference to all creatures, now I have ſpoken of Gods preſence in reference to it ſelfe, and ſo it is the nature and being of God eſſentially.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I have ſpoken of Gods preſence in Chriſt and ſo it is Incomprehenſible, but not the God-head.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I have ſpoken of Gods preſence in a Chriſtian, and from thence I prove that the preſence of God, and the nature of God in a Chriſtian are both one, yet not without ſome diſtinction for our underſtanding, in reſpect of order, and term, laſt of all I have ſpoken of Gods preſence, with every particular creature, and I have proved, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with them, conſider it in a reſpect to it ſelfe, and it is his nature, conſider of it in a reſpect to the creature, and in reſpect of thoſe things that it produceth, and it is not it, the preſence of God is one thing, and that that the preſence produceth and cauſeth to be, is another, every torment in hell is in ſome reſpects produced by the preſence of God, but every torment is not the preſence of God, now all the Righteouſneſſe of God cauſing and producing thoſe torments, and the preſence of God bearing them up in the torment in it ſelfe is the nature of God, it is not the nature or preſence eſſentiall, but a degree thereof, the preſence of God is one in all places, not one in all Reſpects, the ſame preſence that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And the firſt particular, the preſence of God. I come now to Anſwer the ſecond queſtion, whither the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is not but where his eſſence is, I will give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer, having ſpokenſſomthing to it already by ſpeaking of the ſecond thing, which is the Omne-preſence of God,

                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.23, 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8. God fills all places with his preſence and ſpirit, all places are full of the preſence and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, the preſence of God, is where his Spirit is, and that is in all places.</p>
               <p>The preſence and Spirit of God is where his eſſence is not, I ſhall ſpeak in particular too, and illuſtrate ſome things that I ſaid before, obſerve this, all places cannot comprehend the eſſentiall nature of being of God, God is in heaven, and in all creatures that are in heaven, every particular Saint and Angell, ſhall be ſo full of the glory of God, as that now no heart is able to conceive of, yet every particular Saint and Angell, ſhall receive for themſelves a particular Crowne of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. yet there ſhall not bee two, but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite eſſentiall glory, that ſhall give ſo many ſeverall crownes of glory, to ſo many ſever all perſons as ſhall be in heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. yet all theſe glorious numberleſſe beings in Heaven, cannot comprehend the eſſentiall glory of God, God will be in heaven and in hell, and in all places, and creatures, that ſhall have beeing, yet all places, and all creatures too, cannot comprehend the Infiniteneſſe of the Almighty. So then this is a truth, that the preſence and Spirit of God, is, and for ever ſhall be, where the eſſence of God is not, nor cannot be, I ſuppoſe I have given ſufficient inſtances in my firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the firſt Query, the greatneſſe, and goodneſſe of God, is ſo in all creatures, as that in reſpect of all creatures, it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, yet God is greater in power, and being in himſelf eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, above what he is in greatneſſe, preſence, power, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all creatures, and thus much for the fifth Attribute, the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>I now come to the ſixth, the providence of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.19. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Jane.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>King,</hi> 17.1. Chap. 18.45. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.3, 4. A queſtion will ariſe, and that is this, whether the providence of God have any hand, in the redemption and convertion of a Chriſtian, yea, or no? to which I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>That us God by his power doth beare up and preſerve all things, ſo by his providence hee rules and orders all things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, God by his Providence doth rule all things in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:113757:40"/>but then ſecondly, the Redemption and converſion of a Chriſtian is an act of Gods providence, it is not onely one creature, but all creatures are ruled by the Providence of God, it is not only one thing, but all things doe come to paſſe by Gods Providence, the eternall power and God head is made manifeſt, by its Providence, in ruling and ordering all creatures, and all things too.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the Redemption and converſion of a Chriſtian is ſuch a work, as that all the Attributes of God have a great hand in the accompliſhing thereof; if I may ſpeak after the manner of men, then conſider, firſt, there is a Providence that is externall; ſecondly, a Providence that is internall; yet this diſtinction makes not this Attribute, the Providence of God, to bee two but one, that Providence, which I ſay is externall, is that that rules thoſe things which are externall and viſible; the things of this world, as they are carryed on in the courſe of nature, in the compaſſe of the creation, and in this reſpect, the Providence of God becomes viſible by the workings and appearances of it, in thoſe things which are viſible, the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfections of God, conſider them in reference to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, are made viſible to the creature, by the creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. the Providence of God, is the element that every creature doth ſubſiſt in, and every creature under this notion, is a dependance upon the Providence of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29, 30, 31. <hi>Act.</hi> 27.34. Secondly, the Providence inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, is that which rules and orders all things in the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, things that are internall, ſpirituall, and inviſible, this is the ſame Attribute, but not the ſame act, nor in the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: the actings, and internall appearances of Gods Providence in the new creation, makes all things one with it ſelf, I doe not ſay, that the ſpirituall divine workings of Gods Providence in this inviſible internall world, doth make all things to be one eſſentiall Attribute with it ſelf, for then a man by converſion, might approach ſo neer to the obedience of Chriſt, as to be made and called, and ſo become divine, and God eſſentially, but every thing is made one with Providence, by the ſublime outgoings of Providence, in reſpect of union, and conformity, but no creature can be made to be, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:113757:41"/>eſſentially. The providence of God conſider it, not as it is in any forme or creature only, but in the Abſtract, in it ſelfe, and it is Abſolutely and eſſentially God. The Seventh, Attribute is the Immutability of God, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 102.26.27. From hence obſerve that the cauſe of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and eternall union with God, is the Immutabilitie or unchangeableneſſe of God, this is our preſent, and will be our Eternall glory in Heaven, that thoſe whom God loves once, he loves for ever; The immutabilitie of God; by which he is one and the ſame from Eternity, to Eternity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he make changes and alterations in all creatures, is abſolutely, and eſſentially God, the uttermoſt, and higheſt, glory, of Gods Immutability, ſtretcht out upon the higheſt pinne was never made manifeſt in one, nor in all creatures both in Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>The Eighth Attribute is Gods faithfulneſſe, and truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. That which I have to ſay is this, God is faithfull, becauſe he is Immutable, God is faithfull becauſe he is God, he cannot but performe what he hath promiſed, he cannot deny himſelfe, nor that word of Truth which is gone out of his mouth, nothing ſhall be ever able to Alter or change his minde from doing that which he hath ordained from Eternity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Laſt 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. it is Impoſſible that God, and his truth ſhould ſeaſe to be, or from being what it hath beene Eternally, firſt the truth and faithfulneſſe of God is the ſalvation and glory of this world, the truth of God is his unlimited power, by which men are freed from the bondage of corruption, to ſerve the true and living God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. This is that which is one, and cannot be two, it cannot be divided or ſeperated from God, Secondly, All the truth that is in all Saints, in all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is no other; but this one truth which is God, Thirdly, the life and glory of the Lord Jeſus, together with the life and glory of all things both in Heaven and Earth, I meane all things that have the truth of life and glory in them, is, the truth and faithfulneſſe of God, this is that that hath exalted both Angels and men, this is that that all the Saints and Angels in Heaven and Earth do depend upon, if it were poſſible for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113757:41"/>God to lye or deny himſelfe, Heaven it ſelfe, with all thoſe perſons and glories which are there, ſubſiſting in glory thorow the truth and faithfulneſſe of God, would then ſeace to be, yea and all things elſe whatſoever muſt needes periſh and come to nothing, were it not for this there would be no Heaven, nor Hell neither, for how could theſe be, when God himſelfe ſhould ſeace to be? laſt of all the truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of God, is the eſſentiall glory of the Lord Jeſus, the eſſentiall glory of Jeſus Chriſt is Abſolutely and eſſentially God, God is ſo true and faithfull, that were there ten worlds as, there is not, and though every ſoule in them were filled, above what we could expreſſe, full of Gods truth and Spirit, yet could not all theſe worlds, nor all theſe multitudes and numberleſſe numbers of ſpirits, thus inlightened by the ſpirit, be ever able to ſee and to expreſſe the utmoſt and higheſt glory, that is wrapt up in the truth and faithfulneſſe of God, I Appeale to all that in the truth doe love, and in the ſpirit doe know God, whither the conſolations of Gods truth and faithfulneſſe are not deare unto them, <hi>Job</hi> 2.2. <hi>chapt.</hi> 15.11.</p>
               <p>The ninth Attribute, and the laſt that I intend to ſpeake of, is Gods Eternity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8 <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.2. Who is able to declare the Eternity of God? now if the ſpirit of any man be Immutable let him come forth and Anſwer, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Attribute of God, I ſhall aske theſe queſtions, and ſo end with a concluſion or two, and they are theſe; behold God exalted by his power, canſt thou teach or inſtruct like him? canſt thou underſtand the ſpreading of the Clouds, or the voice of Gods Tabernacle? haſt thou an Arme like God, or canſt thou Thunder out with thy voyce like the Almighty, if all the Internall Inviſible perfections of the moſt high God, are according to thy words are depainted, and diſcribed in the mortall fleſh of man, come forth and diſcover this perfection, that all the world may wonder, and be Aſtoniſhed at the appearance of thy greatneſſe. Where waſt thou when God laid the foundations of the Earth? who hath laid the meaſures thereof, or who hath ſtretched out the line upon it, whereupon are the foundations thereof faſtened, or who hath
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:113757:42"/>ſhut up the Sea with doores, when it brake forth, as if it had iſſued out of the wombe, haſt thou commanded the morning ſince thy dayes, or cauſed the day ſpring to know his place? haſt thou entered into the ſprings of the Sea, or haſt thou walked in the ſearch of the depth; have the gates of death beene opened to thee, and canſt thou command the doores thereof? haſt thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare it if thou haſt underſtanding, where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkneſſe where is the place thereof? Knoweſt thou it becauſe thou waſt then borne, or becauſe the number of thy dayes be great, haſt thou entered into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the ſnow, or haſt thou ſeene the treaſures of the haile? by what way is light parted, which ſcattereth the Eaſt winde upon the Earth? haſt thou divided a water courſe for the over-flowings of water: or away for the lightening and thunder? thou that knoweſt man to be as perfect as God, yea to be God himſelfe, Anſwer me, out of whoſe wombe came the Ice, and the hoary Froſt of Heaven, who hath gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, canſt thou binde the ſweete influences of Pleiades, or looſe the bands of <hi>Orion,</hi> canſt thou bring forth <hi>Mazzoroth</hi> in his ſeaſon: or canſt thou guide <hi>Arctuerus</hi> with his ſonnes. Knoweſt thou the ordinances of Heaven, canſt thou ſet the dominion thereof in the earth? canſt thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that aboundance of waters may cover thee, canſt thou ſend lightenings that they may goe and ſay unto thee here we are? who hath put Wiſdome into the inward parts, or who hath given underſtanding to the heart, canſt thou number the Clouds in Wiſdome, or canſt thou ſtay the bottles of Heaven? declare this if thou knoweſt it all.</p>
               <p>My concluſions are theſe, God is infinite in Immortalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Secondly, it was never, neither can be for ever, fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by all creatures in Heaven and Earth, laſt of all the Immortallity or Eternity of God, is abſolutely and eſſentially God, and thus much for a diſcription of Gods Attributes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I am to ſpeake of, is this, what is the mortall fleſh of man, and this our Saviour and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.1. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.44. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4, 12 <hi>Pſa.</hi> 39.4.5.6. the 103.14.15. and 19.47.48. <hi>Job</hi> 10.9.10.11.

               <p>Firſt, the mortall fleſh of man is the throne and ſeat of all filthineſſe and abominations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the mortall fleſh of man is ſubject to mortality and vanity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the mortall fleſh of man is ſubject to all ſorrows, miſeries, torments and judgements, that by ſin doe fall upon the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the fleſh of Chriſt whileſt it was mortall, had not all the internall perfections of God depainted in it.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the fleſh of all men whilſt it is mortall, is not, nor when this mortality ſhall put on immortality, yet then it ſhall never be as perfect as God, nor God himſelf. Now this muſt needs be moſt falſe and untrue; that all the Attributes and internall perfections, which are proper to the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God are depainted and deſcribed in the mortall fleſh of man, the mortall fleſh of man is not eternall, immutable, and infinitely powerfull, as God in his Attributes is, and now I have done with the firſt part of this <hi>Raviſhing Book</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie.</hi> I now come to the laſt part, which is, that man may be known to be as perfect as God, yet to be God himſelfe. I ſhall ſpeak but a word to this, being I have already proved the contrary, no man is ſo perfect as God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, man is not God himſelf, Jeſus Chriſt is perfect God and perfect man; now his perfect manhood, is not his godhead, it is not as perfect as God, nor God himſelf, and if Chriſts manhood be not God himſelf, then much leſſe, the mortall fleſh of man, and thus much in Anſwer to this <hi>Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Book, Miracle,</hi> or <hi>Prodigie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now it is poſſible, for leſſe then the higheſt territory of a Chriſtians capacity, to finde out the depth of this, <hi>O unheard of blaſphemy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt branch of the errour I ſhall conclude with, is this, that though imagination inject, that is, conceit and include, the forme man, though an Idea of Chriſt crucified, that is, a reſemblance, forme, or Image, preſent it ſelf to us, yet the Ocean of Faith, drownes, and annihilates, that is, makes void or of no effect, the ſame, that is, that all the apprehentions of

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> God ſpake to them after the manner of men, and his buſineſſe with them in this dark obſcure appearance, under the Law, was not very high and glorious, and in this reſpect, the caſe was ſuch betwixt him and man, as that hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon ſuch termes with them under the old Covenant of works, that whatſoever they got they ſhould have, if they would have outward and inward bleſſings, they muſt deſerve them, and that they could never do, and ſo never obtain them; now theſe were the thoughts of God to that people, under that Covenant, and in that appearance, all muſt bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if they would work and obey, they ſhould eate the good of the Land, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. if they would not, hee would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; It is true, they could doe nothing without his power, but once hee gave them power to do all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee ſhould command of them, but they loſt it, and God was not bound to reſtore it againe, neither was he bound to take away that Law of Commandements, which before hee gave unto them, when they had power to fulfill it.</p>
               <p>What would man have been after his fall, if God had in all reſpects left him to himſelf? if hee had left him Lawleſſe, hee would have been like a wilde beaſt, making further ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of himſelfe and all things; hee was not able to ſubſiſt of himſelf, nor to winde and turn all things in the world, but muſt preſently ſinke and periſh, now man had a great deſire to live, though hee and all his poſterity were to dye at laſt, then to have dyed preſently out of hand; <hi>Adam</hi> thought to hide himſelf from God, now if God did any thing for him, it was out of love, meerly for his names ſake, man could not challenge any thing at the hands of God, now whileſt man and all his poſterity was under this cloud of darkneſſe, God himſelfe found out a way of deliverance.</p>
               <p>O man, what canſt thou ſay for thy ſelf, or what canſt thou charge the Almighty with? I doe hear many objections raiſed

               <p>Firſt, of all, all things whatſoever, is not God in his eſſence,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> That the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are fully to be reduced to the Creator, and conſequently, as whatſoever is in the beam and heat ſo conſidered, is no other then Sun and fire it ſelf, ſo is there nothing in the creature, which is not the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf, pag. 77.</note> of all creatures, none are ſo glorious as Saints and Angels, which are elected, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the life of Chriſt and a Chriſtian is both one and the ſame ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. hee that is joyned unto the Lord, is one ſpirit; Againe, the life of Chriſt and a Chriſtian, is both one and the ſame God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.22. whatſoever is abſolutely pure and divine, is God, but the life of a Chriſtian is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the pure divine glory of the Lord Jeſus, therefore that life is God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the eſſence, is all in all, and will bee ſo for ever, but the nature of God in a Chriſtian, is not all in all, therefore, it is not God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the eſſence is the firſt cauſe of all things, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cannot bee the cauſe and effect too, therefore not God, that is, not God in his eſſence, but God in his appearance, God in electing a Saint and converting him, is not in one and the ſame appearance in reference to the creature, in electing there is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:113757:46"/>but one infinite appearance of God, to himſelf, and all things that are ordained to bee, God ſees them in that one appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or in himſelf, as really as hee doth now they are, God ſees all things at once, and all things at once are one eternall act of God, and every thing in this reſpect is from Eternity. God decreed all things before any thing had a beeing, before any creature did appeare to any creature, then was God all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God was not all from Eternity any other way then hee is now, for if God were all things from Eternity, ſo he is now, hee is not leſſe then hee was, neither is hee more, all the glory that hee hath given to all creatures, is no decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his glory, God is all things, miſapprehend mee not I pray you, that is, hee is all the divine ſweetneſſe, that is in all creatures; the devill, as a creature is good, but God is not the nature or beeing of any creature but a Chriſtian, and hee is not his nature neither, in reference to his corruption and creation, but in reference to his Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God is in and preſent with every creature, I prove it thus, whatſoever it bee that hath any thing of God in it, in that, and with that God is preſent, but every creature hath ſomething of God in it, therefore God muſt needs bee in and preſent with all creatures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, every creature is preſent with, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the glory of God, Gods glory is his infiniteneſſe, if there bee any thing without God, or that in this reſpect is not in God, then God cannot bee infinite, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him wee live, move, and have our beeing,</hi> there is not any thing of God (obſerve I pray you) in any creature, without God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wee will have more Gods then one.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, all things are God in his works and ſeverall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, every work and creature is an appearance and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of God, for God hath therefore made all creatures, that hee might diſcover himſelfe to them, and not to diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to himſelfe, ſo then every appearance, diſcovery, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation or work of God, is God, the way that I ſhall take to make good this according to the Word is this, every appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or work of God, is God in that appearance, the devill is a creature, an appearance of God, therefore, in that notion and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113757:46"/>reſpect he is God, yea, but how? there lies the myſtery, not in every reſpect, for in ſome reſpects it is as great a falſehood, as in any reſpect a truth, as he is a creature or work of God, good in his creation, the manifeſtation of, and being ordained for this condition, for Gods power, as his ſervant, to doe all things, <hi>Job</hi> 1.12. Chap. 40.19. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.18.21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.1. according to his eternall counſell, for to bring about his end, ſo he is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God, and God is in that appearance, now conſider that Gods end, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. and the devills are not one, but two, and in this hee is a devill, an abominable lyer, and the Prince of darkneſſe, yet all this is not abſolutely againſt his will, yet God cannot juſtly according to truth, be made to be the authour of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. neither doth hee work, it into the devill, or into the hearts of men, it is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemy to ſpeak it, the devill is the firſt founder and father thereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. Chap. 4.3.</p>
               <p>The fall of men and Angels was ordained from Eternity, and if they had not been ordained for deſtruction, they ſhould never have been deſtroyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. <hi>God hath created all things for himſelf, and the wicked for the day of evill,</hi> Jude 4. <hi>Therefore hee hath mercy on whom hee will, and whom hee will hee hardneth: At the potter hath power over the clay, to make a veſſell either for honour or diſhonour, ſo hath God power over all creatures, to ſave or condemne, according to the good pleaſure of his will, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his power and juſtice, through his infinite patience and long ſufferance, upon them which are veſſels of wrath, and to make his mercy known on them which hee hath prepared unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9. <hi>All things ſhall bee according to the will of God,</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ever bee, that is quite contrary to his will; conſider of Gods will under theſe two notions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Secret; ſecondly, a revealed will, now the revealed will cannot bee againſt the ſecret, for then the Kingdome of God, or God in his will would bee divided, which thing can never ſtand, whatſoever God is in his Word, the ſame hee is in himſelfe, for God doth not diſcover himſelfe to bee one thing in his word, and yet is not the ſame in deed and in truth, then the Scriptures were worth nothing, being but a meere ſhadow, and a confuſed Hiſtory indeed, and when a Chriſtian ſhould come to injoy God, according to his Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:113757:47"/>according to his Oath, Seales, and evidences of his Spirit he ſhould finde no God at all, all Ordinances were then meate for babes, for fooles, and men voide of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, O then cleave to the Scripture for if that be not truth, then is there no truth at all, nor God neither.</p>
               <p>I doe not ſay that all or every Word that is written there, is truth, there is ſome that is not, thorow the faults of tranſlators, yet God hath bin pleaſed, not to ſuffer it to be violated or changed in the being of it, but hath kept it in their hands from ſuch an extinguſhing corruption, ſuppoſe it were poſſible, ſo to juggell with a wiſe man, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that he were an Emperour and he were not, yet it were impoſſible that he ſhould never come into his Right minde againe, to know the contrary, or ſome of his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after him, if men ſhould come and tell us, that ſuch a booke were the Word and power of God unto Salvation, and we ſhould not ſee the ſame comming along in it and with it, it is not poſſible that ſo many wiſe men ſhould be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the receiving of it, but ſhould in one age or another by ſome meanes or other heare of the contrary.</p>
               <p>Every appearance of God is God, not God in his eſſence, but God in his appearance, all the beames of the Sunne is the Sunne, no man can ſay it is any thing elſe, and it is a truth that cannot be denyed, but how, the beame is not the Sunne in its eſſence, but in its appearance, for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall body of light is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>The greateſt falſhood and lye in the World may be a truth in its firſt Denomination, but in the way or manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, confirming, and inlarging it, it may be made to be a lye, ſome men withhold the truth of God in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if men could but hold to the firſt principle, which is the ground of all Religions, and not forſake that in one Reſpect which they acknowledge in another, a Papiſt would then be a Proteſtant, a Familiſt would then not be Heriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, but heavenly, and ſo there would be but one Religion in the world.</p>
               <p>Every thing both in Heaven and Earth is one Infinite univerſall appearance of God, and every particular Creature,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113757:47"/>is a particular appearance; the Divell is God, in one of his greateſt appearances, namely of his great power, <hi>Job</hi> 41.24.25. a Worme is God alſo, but in a leſſer appearance, yet God in himſelfe is neither leſſe nor more, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, God is in every Creature, but not Infinitely, every particular Creature hath God in it, but not the God-head or eſſence, for if God who is Infinite, were Infinitely in any one Creature, or in all Creatures then he could be no where elſe, and that Creature muſt needes be equall with God, or if his Eſſence were in all Creatures he would then be limited, ſo you may ſee the falſhood of that Doctrine, that the life of the leaſt Creature is Incomprehenſible, comprehending and containing all things, if the eſſence were in one appearance, then all the light and glory of the Sunne, would be comprehended in the breadth of your hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection,</hi> But ſome will ſay, that the ſame light that is here, is alſo every where one and the ſame in all places, for life is one in all Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I grant, that the Sunne is one and the ſame in all the world, but not in every reſpect, it is the ſame in its eſſence, unchangeable without increaſing or decreaſing, but it is not the ſame in its appearance, the Sunne at one and the ſame time may be in its beames wateriſh in ſome places, in other places it may be glorious, God is the ſame God in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he is in himſelfe, that God that is in the Creature, is the ſame who is one light and glory, and is eſſentiall, but he is not the ſame in his appearance, for then every particular appearance would be an eſſence, and ſo there would be many eſſences and Gods.</p>
               <p>God is the ſame in all Creatures, that he is in himſelfe for ſubſtance in many reſpects, not in degree, I doe not meane that the ſubſtance which every Creature is made of, is the nature or eſſence of God, yet we cannot exclude God from any Creature, you cannot ſee any Creature but you may ſee God there, neither can he be Included in all Creatures, hee is all things, yet hee is above all things, and is not the beeing or nature of any thing, Secondly, God is not nameleſſe, as ſome affirme, or ſo inviſible as not to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113757:48"/>be known or manifeſted, firſt of all, No man hath ſeen God at any time, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>Whom never man ſaw nor can ſee,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. Yea, but Jeſus Chriſt hath revealed him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2. That that wee have ſeen declare wee unto you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>Philip, Hee that hath ſeen mee hath ſeen the Father, how ſayeſt thou then ſhew us the Father,</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>The Word was made fleſh and dwelt amongſt us, and wee ſaw the glory thereof,</hi> Joh. 1.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Immanuel, which by interpretation is God with us,</hi> Matth. 1.23. Eſa. 7.14.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſecondly, God is ſuch a good as that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that hee ſhould bee made better; my Righteouſneſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not unto thee, hee that is wiſe is wiſe for himſelfe, and a man hath the profit of his own labours: this doth deny God to bee infinite, I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge yee what I ſay, and what Antichriſt ſaith, and ſee what ſenſe there is in their deſcription of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God is all, but God is not the univerſall frame and inclination of every creature, God is all the divine ſweetneſſe that is in them, God is all things and in all things, as all things were conceived in the wombe of his eternall Counſell, God is not the nature of any thing but of a Chriſtian, and not his nature neither, as I ſaid before, in reference to the old <hi>Adam,</hi> but the new; and indeed that is not ſo properly a Chriſtians as it is Gods, the nature was before as good, and it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it is in all creatures and Angels but not good to them ſo, as to bee a good actually within them, yet good to them in reference to Eternity; I ſay againe, that God is not the frame and inclination of any creature, God is not the frame of the devill, nor the frame of mans heart; Remember the diſtinction, all that is divine and heavenly in all creatures, that God is, and ſo hee hath been from everlaſting, the life and goodneſſe of all creatures that hee had ordained to bee created in time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God was not every creatures goodneſſe from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, in a reſpect to the creatures particular beeing, as it is now, neither was the creature good to God through his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from all eternity in every reſpect as it is now, for God in his decree, did not ſee things confuſedly, nor in a ſhadow,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:113757:48"/>nor out of a divine order, God did never look upon things that were not, neither did hee look upon things that were ever to bee more then they are, hee did not look upon the world and all things, from Eternity, as hee doth now, yet hee ſees nor knows no more now, then hee ſaw and knew from Eternity, the underſtanding of God is infinite, <hi>Job</hi> 14.12, 13. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.34, 35. <hi>Thou art the ſame, and thy yeers ſhall not faile, Heb.</hi> 1.13. Hee ſaw all things then as perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were, as hee doth now, now they have a beeing, for hee cannot increaſe in knowledge, power, or wiſdome, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe that now which hath not been in his thoughts from Eternity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the eſſence is not moveable, nor active according to the motion, or after the manner of men, to begin now, and anon to have done ſo much, and to morrow to end, but when God begins all things, hee ends them too; God in all his works and Counſels, is the beginning and the end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. Chap. 22.13. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 41.4. Chap. 44.6. if God ſhould act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to men, judge what will follow, let us a little weigh and conſider the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if man could begin and end a work at once, hee in that work would not bee man but God, but this hee cannot doe for want of power, we muſt not think, that becauſe all things are at once one act of God from Eternity, that therefore God ever did, or can doe any thing confuſedly, but by ſuch infinite wiſdome that is above the knowledge and apprehenſion of all things both in heaven and Earth, in reſpect of God nothing had a beginning; to us all things have their reall beginnings and endings, yet God doth begin a work and end it, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it ſelf really, but to God all things are eternall; when an Artiſt would make a curious work that was never made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee can work it with his hands to make it viſible and fit for uſe, hee muſt firſt contrive it in his minde, it muſt be made there, and then according to that inward platforme, hee guides his hand and inſtrument, now in ſome reſpect it is ſo with God, not in all.</p>
               <p>The Workes of God are firſt in his minde, before hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin any thing to make it viſible, either to it ſelf, or to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113757:49"/>whatſoever, and then, according to that eternall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of infinite and divine wiſdome within him, hee orders and doth all things.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt difference is this, Arts and curious works, doe come into the minde of man that was never there before, for that is it that increaſeth his glory amongſt men, but, with God it is otherwiſe, for in the beginning of the creation, a worke, that neither men nor Angels had a hand in, nothing came into the minde of God, that was not there from Eternity, either in the beginning, in the Progreſſe, or end thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference is this; God by doing of all things, did not inrich himſelf, in wiſdome, power, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r glory, not in the leaſt meaſure, but did all things for the manifeſtation of the ſame unto thoſe whom hee had ordained to know it, either for their ſalvation or damnation, but with man it is otherwiſe; for all that he doth, he doth it, that by it he might inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and increaſe his honour and excellency amongſt men; and when hee hath it, then hee can diſcover it, now as God never did any thing to inrich himſelf, ſo hee never did any thing to bee a manifeſtation of himſelf to himſelf, in any other way, then hee knew from Eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, God is all things, that is, God is the firſt originall cauſe of all things, and all things in their originall is God, now wee muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt God and his works, the works of God are all in God, and God is in all his works, but, the works of God are not God, nor never were, when God did purpoſe to create Heaven and Earth, and all things in them, then, when they were in his purpoſe, they were not God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had a beeing, no more then they are now; now they have a beeing, the purpoſe or Counſell of God, take it in all reſpects is God; but all the works of God are not his Counſel, Will, and Determination, but the effect and diſcovery of it.</p>
               <p>The Will and Counſell of God is in all creatures, and all creatures are in Gods Will, but all creatures are not his will in the eſſence of it; but in the manifeſtation of it, the Will of God is abſolutely God, but how? not in a bare ſingle reſpect, for then wee ſhould make God to bee nothing but Will, the Power of God, the Wiſdome, Knowledge, Love, Light, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:113757:49"/>Mercy in God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. Chap. 1.5. <hi>Job</hi> 12. God hath not an infinite Will to doe any thing, but ſo as hee hath alſo an infinite underſtanding to know why hee wills the being or good of any thing, and hee is as infinite in power alſo to accompliſh and bring to paſſe whatſoever hee will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.26.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſeventhly, God is this and that good, both in his ſervants and in all creatures, that is continually named, known diſcovered, and injoyed, the name of God is whatſoever God is, <hi>I am</hi> ſaith <hi>God to Moſes, I am</hi> infinite, <hi>I am</hi> ſuch a beeing, as thou nor all creatures are able to conceive of, unleſſe you were gods equal with my ſelf, <hi>I am God the Almighty,</hi> the <hi>Everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This name ſignifies the bleſſed Trinity, <hi>I am that I am, I am</hi> Jehovah, <hi>I am All in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The name of <hi>God,</hi> is the Word, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The name of <hi>God,</hi> is the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. and this is that by which hee doth diſcover and reveale himſelfe unto us, and that by which wee come to injoy communion with him, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. We know that God in his higheſt and greateſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, cannot bee known, named, or manifeſted, not to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but God knows himſelf, and all things in himſelf, for nothing can bee above that that is infinite, God cannot bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove himſelf, now it cannot any way bee made good, that God is nameleſſe, either in reſpect of himſelf, or in reſpect of his creatures, what ſhould wee call him, when wee call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name? There is no man but calls him God, unleſſe it bee an Atheiſt, and theſe that ſay that hee is nameleſſe, do call him by many names, the true Light, the true Love, the true Good, the true Life, and many other termes which they give him, as you may ſee in their Writings.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The inviſible power and God-head, is in, and made manifeſt by every creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. When God doth diſcover himſelf to us by the creatures, hee doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover no more of himſelfe by them, then what is in them; it is by the light and glory of the Spirit of God within me, that it comes to paſſe that I know any thing of God in thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are without mee, now if God ſhould diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no other wayes then in and by the creatures, then wee
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113757:50"/>ſhould never know more of God, then what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his works doe declare, nor know him no other way, then by the creatures, but God doth diſcover that to the Saints by the Spirit, which they cannot ſee in the whole creation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. ver. 12.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This world in its higheſt eſtate of glory, could never diſcover a particular crucified Jeſus to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">None are able to diſcover the Glory of God either in his perſon or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but to diſcover a glimps of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That I deſire this truth trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in unity may be often read and conſidered of, it being, the ground and foundation of all Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> We cannot Reade in the large booke of this Creation, the pardon of our ſinnes by Jeſus Chriſt, nor our Reconciliation with our God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This world in its brighteſt appearance, cannot diſcover that deceitefull Antichriſt that is within us and without us too, no, it is the Bleſſed Spirit of our Lord and Saviour, that doth diſcover all ſuch ſecret myſteries of Divine glory unto our ſpirits, the whole world in the time of its continuance before Chriſt, did never diſcover God in ſuch a manner and meaſure as Chriſt did, if a man knowes all things in this world; yet if he know not God in the ſpirit, he knowes nothing as he ought to know.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What difference is there betweene the eſſence of God, and God in his perſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Conſider of God in his Perſon, and he is the firſt in the Trinity, the Father, and is not the Sonne in his Perſon, or the Holy Spirit, ſo conſider of Chriſt in Reference to his Perſon, and he is the ſecond in the Trinity, and not the firſt, nor the laſt; Conſider of the Holy Spirit in his Perſon and he is ſo likewiſe, but conſider of God in his God-head or Eſſence, and he is the whole Trinity, he is the firſt and the laſt. Now I deſire with Reverence and ſubmiſſion, for the confounding of Antichriſt in many of his concluſions, who would if it were poſſible plucke God out of his Throne of Majeſty and glory, and ſet himſelfe downe in his Roome, to diſcover this myſterie to you. Conſider of the order of the bleſſed Trinity, and obſerve this, that God is not in every Reſpect, above all order, it cannot be true, for, firſt, the order of the glorious Trinity is God, the beeing of God is not a confuſed, but he is a beeing of Divine order.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the order of the bleſſed Trinity is Infinite, and cannot be apprehended, nor comprehended by all creatures
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113757:50"/>in Heaven and Earth, art thou able to diſcerne the Infinite wiſdome of the Trinity in the Divine order thereof, art thou able to expreſſe the myſtery of that Eſſentiall glory, that all Saints and Angels in Heaven and Earth have ever bin inquiring into? but can never finde out, the depth of that unexpreſſible wiſedome; that from Eternity hath bin ſeated there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The order of the glorious Trinity is the Trinity, the Father, who is firſt, the Sonne ſecond, the Holy Spirit the third, we cannot conſider of the order of the Trinity without the diſtinction of perſons, and we cannot conſider of the order and diſtinction of Perſons in the Trinity, without the union, both of Perſons and natures, the diſtinction is, God diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into three perſons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The God-head is not the three Perſons, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Spirit, in a way of confuſion, but in a way of order; againe, the Father Sonne and Holy Spirit is not one and the ſame God but in a way of order.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God is above all created order, either of Angels or men, for the order of the God-head, in ſome Reſpects is the God-head, the Father he is firſt, and that by order, and he is not the Sonne, for then there would bee more Sonnes then one, or rather none at all; againe, the Sonne is the ſecond, and not the firſt, nor the third, ſo the holy Spirit is the third, and not the Father, nor the Sonne, now if it were not for this, there would be no Trinity, aboliſh this, and you deny the Trinity.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, God is a being of Divine order in all his workes, <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt formed then <hi>Eve,</hi> God divided the time wherein he did all things, into ſix dayes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and he did that by a divine order, looke upon the whole Creation, as it is the worke of God, and ſee what a glorious order there is amongſt all Creatures, <hi>Jſa.</hi> 64.4. if you conſider of the conſent that there is amongſt the Creatures, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all thoſe differences and contrarieties that are in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to one another, looke upon the univerſall compoſuall of all Creatures, and ſee how they are fitted one to another, looke upon the combination and connexion that is among
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113757:51"/>the creatures, and in all this you may ſee the ſweet order that is among them; O then, how Heavenly is the order of the Trinity! diſorder is the confuſion of all things, and ſin is that that hath put all things concerning man out of order, for a man to ſee a mighty Army, in a difficult place, againſt a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Enemy, ſet in order, what ſweet union can they then have in all their Battailes ſo long as they keep order? What a bleſſed thing it is to ſee a Kingdome in good Order, wee all pray for ſuch a day, that ſo many pretious lives might not bee loſt as are, what a glorious thing it is to ſee a Parliament in order, doe wee not at this preſent ſee and injoy the benefit of it, ſo conſider of it, in the things of God, is it not an excellent thing to ſee a man walk orderly? is it not an Angelicall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thing, to ſee a Church gathered and governed by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Goſpell Order, to ſee every Ordinance inſtituted in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Order, what a profitable thing it is to heare a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſt and him crucified, preached in order; Order in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects, is the firſt cauſe of union; O look and admire, at the ſweet and unexpreſſible order and union of the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! if there be no order, there cannot be any union, union is not firſt, and then order, the Father is firſt, and begets the Son, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. the Spirit proceeds from both, and then there is union; conſider of the order, union, and diſtinction of perſons and natures in the Trinity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall open what I have ſaid by ſpeaking a word concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtians union with Chriſt, Chriſt and a Chriſtian are both one in their originall, in nature, in the ſpirit and glory of God,

               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is the Son of God, ſo is a Chriſtian too.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is two natures in the perſon of Chriſt, the Divine, and the humane made heavenly by participation, ſo there is in a Chriſtian, the difference is this.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:113757:51"/>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt in his perſon, is the firſt begotten and firſt born of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. the perſon of a Chriſtian is the next begotten of God, in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the perſon of Chriſt is the Word of God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. and was ever with the Father, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. the perſon of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian was eternally with God in his eternall Decree, but not the Word, as Chriſt was.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The perſon of Chriſt is that by which God made the worlds, and by which hee doth uphold and beare up all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. but the perſon of a Chriſtian is not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the union betwixt Chriſt and a Chriſtian is a made union, a union that in reſpect of a Chriſtian had a beginning, but the union of Chriſt in his perſon is without beginning.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A Chriſtians union may bee increaſed, and that may bee diſcovered concerning it, that hee never knew before, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.9 but the union of Chriſt cannot.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The perſon of Chriſt is the ſecond in the Trinity, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. but a Chriſtians perſon, although it bee there, yet not a perſon there, the ſecond difference is this:</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the Offices of Chriſt, in his Kingly Office, he is over all Chriſtians, Angels, and creatures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. laſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. ſo a Chriſtian is a King too, but not as Chriſt is, hee is a made King by Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. hee is a King in the kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. hee is a King towards God, and ſhall receive a Crown, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. hee is more then a man in this world; more then a Conquerour, through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is a Prieſt, ſo is a Chriſtian too, but Chriſt is a Prieſt for ever after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedec, Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>A Prieſt to offer up himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, to make reconciliation, to purchaſe liberty, and everlaſting glory for men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.5 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. But a Chriſtian cannot bee the ſaved, and Saviour too; hee cannot reconcile, ſave, redeem, or give life to any, hee is to praiſe God for ever for Chriſt, and all that comes along with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt in his Propheticall Office, hee is the onely true Miniſter of the Goſpel, hee did bring glad tydings to the world, a Prophet to teach and informe his Church by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113757:52"/>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. So a Chriſtian is a Prophet too, but how? Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mee as I follow Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.11. <hi>To teach the Truth as it is in Ieſus,</hi> for ſo hee hath been taught of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3.33. Hee knows nothing of himſelf, but what Chriſt reveales unto him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. The third difference in a Chriſtians union, is this:</p>
               <p>Chriſt in his eſſence is not onely the Word,
<note place="margin">A Chriſtians union with God is a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſcovery, of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bleſſed Trinitie.</note> but alſo the minde and ſpirit too, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. <hi>Philip, hee that hath ſeen mee, hath ſeen the Father, Rom.</hi> 10, <hi>Hee is God ever all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>laſt. This is that very God, and that eternall life;</hi> But the perſon of a Chriſtian is not the minde, word, and ſpirit, yet hee hath all within him.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, Chriſt and a Chriſtian in their higheſt glory, are not one by union without diſtinction; a diſtinction without ſeparation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. laſt. Now you ſee the oneneſſe that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and a Chriſtian, and you ſee the difference too, the glory of a Chriſtian is ſo great, that none are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, to apprehend or comprehend, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>That that eye hath not ſeen, nor eare hath heard, nor it ever entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of any man, to know that love of God, that paſſeth knowledge:</hi> Now if the glory of a Chriſtian bee ſo great, how infinite is the glory of the Lord Jeſus? the union of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is ſo great, ſo infinitely glorious, that all Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels knows not the utmoſt myſtery thereof, the union is ſo great, that they are one in eſſence, though three in perſon, they are not three Gods but one, every perſon is God, not the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or eſſence.</p>
               <p>The Father in his Eſſence is the whole Trinity, and ſo is the Son and Holy Spirit alſo, but in his Perſon he is not; Chriſt in Reference to his Perſon is the ſecond in the Trinity, that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, aſſumed, and is united to the humane nature, and in that he ſuffered and reconſiled God to man, and man to God, this is not God the Father, he ſends his Son into the world, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16. nor the Spirit, for he reveals Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.17. this is an undeniable truth, the Scriptures doth plainly declare it, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. the Spirit is called another Comforter. <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.26.

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>A Diſcription of the Devill.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF all the wayes, and workes of God in this world, the Devill is the greateſt and the Chiefeſt, <hi>Iob.</hi> 40.19. and 41.34. there in no created being in this world, that is ſo great in power as the Devill is, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.2. he is called the Prince that ruleth in the Ayre, and hee is thus called for two Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe of the greatneſſe of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Secondly, his greatneſſe in being, there are but two kingdomes, the Kingdome of God, the kingdome of the Devill, the Kingdom of light, and the kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Secondly, this world by reaſon of ſinne, lyes under a thick cloud of darkeneſſe, the Devill by his workes is this covering and cloud, that over-ſhaddows the face of the whole Earth. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19. the Univerſall frame of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evill world is nothing elſe but a frame of wickedneſſe, the Devill is called the god of this world, in reference to its defilement and pollution by the ſinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Devill is the great Ruler and manager of all things
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:113757:53"/>that are in his kingdome and dominion he is the Ruler of all things, and of all ſpirits too, who have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under his power, by iniquitie, hee is for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his power compared to <hi>Leviathan, Iob</hi> 49.23. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold hee drinketh up a River and haſteth not, he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth, we know that Nations and Kingdomes are compared to waters <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.15. The Devill is ſuch a devourer of Nations, as <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> is of waters, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> by his power doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thoſe Rivers that he drinketh up, ſo the Devill by his power doth comprehend all the Nations and Kingdoms that are in this world, conſider of <hi>Leviathan</hi> in theſe three reſpects, his greatneſſe in being, he is above all Creatures, his power in action, and thoſe mighty effects and events that are continually produced by him, by reaſon of theſe he becomes a wonder to all that ſhall behold him.</p>
               <p>So conſider of the Devill alſo, his greatneſſe in being, by which he can be preſent in all places in this world, his power in action there is no Creature can out-goe him in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and there are many things aſcribed to him that cannot be aſcribed to any other Creature either in Heaven or Earth, he is called Legion, that is, many, hee is called God, and Father, the Father of ſinne, the Father of ſinners, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.38.44. <hi>Yee are of your father the Devill,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Ye doe that that you have ſeene with your father, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.8. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that he that committeth ſinne is of the Devill. Thirdly, conſider thoſe mighty effectes, that are continually produced by him and in this he is above all Created powers whatſoever. Fourthly, all things in this world under this notion, are at once, and at all times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the heart and eye of the Devill, <hi>Iob</hi> 41.34. he beholdeth all high things, there be two ſorts of things that the Scriptures cals high things, the things of God, and they are really high, ſo high that none can comprehend the heighth of them, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. the other ſort of high things, are the things of men, and theſe are not really high, they are high onely in the accoumpt of men, now theſe are the things that the eye of the Devill doth behold and comprehend,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113757:53"/>
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.8. The Devill at once did ſhow our Saviour all the Kingdomes and Glories of this world, there be two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thrones which the Devill Rules in; the Ayre, and the hearts of ungodly men <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. both theſe are the proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſeate and throne of the Devill, he is not the Ayre, as ſome ſay and affirme, but is in, and Rules there, he is not the hearts nor breath of men, but is in, and is the chiefe Ruler there alſo.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Devill is the greateſt power, and higheſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie, that doth continually oppoſe the glory of Chriſt, and the ſalvation of a Chriſtian, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. <hi>For we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers, and againſt the Worldly Governours, the Princes of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt Spirituall wickedneſſes which are in high places:</hi> The Devill is one of theſe Principalities and Spirituall wickedneſſes that the Saints did, and doe wreſtle againſt, wee know that there is no ſuch wreſtling or ſtriving betweene two parties that are agreed, the Devill he wreſtles and ſtrives with a Chriſtian, and thinks to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour; a Chriſtian, he wreſtles with the Devill and is ſure to conquour, now if they were of one minde there could be no difference between them. Secondly, a Chriſtian doth wreſtle againſt fleſh and blood, but fleſh and blood are not theſe Principalities, and Spirituall wickedneſſes that a Chriſtian is to ſtrive againſt, here is a diſtinction, becauſe there is a difference, were there no difference, there would be none, but, no ſuch diſtinction, fleſh and blood are the powers of this world, the powers of this world in this reſpect are ſubject and ſubordinate to thoſe Powers and Principalities; obſerve this, there is a power that a Chriſtian is to ſtrive againſt, which is a greater beeing then the power of fleſh and blood, or thus, the power of fleſh and blood is not the greateſt oppoſition, that lyes in a Chriſtians way towards Heaven, I thinke the power of the Devill amongſt the Familiſts is a higher Principalitie and a greater ſpirituall wickedneſſe, that all Chriſtians are to ſtrive againſt, then the powers of fleſh and blood; now the queſtion is, whether power were created or ever had a beginning, yea or no, I further Anſwer, that if it had no beginning it muſt needes be Eternall, if it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:113757:54"/>be not a Creature it muſt needs be the Creator, and if this be ſo, then what truth is there in this Scripture, and the Word of God, if there be no power but what is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, then we muſt ſtrive and wreſtle againſt the will of God, againe, if power in all creatures be not the Creature it ſelfe, but the Creator himſelfe; then if this Scripture be true God himſelfe is no better then a Spirituall wickedneſſe, a greater blaſphemy I thinke cannot be expreſſed by the tongue of man.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Jeſus Chriſt by his croſſe, hath ſpoiled, captivated, and conquered all the principalities and powers of this world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. the Devill is compared to a Lyon, ſo is Chriſt too, yea, but the devill is compared to a devouring Lyon, for his name in Hebrew is <hi>Abadaon,</hi> in Greek <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that is, a deſtroying deſtroyer, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.11. the Devill in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like a hungery Lyon, alwayes ſeeking whom hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The devill is mighty in underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>They doe beleeve and tremble, Iam.</hi> 2.19. Their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt doth cauſe them to beleeve, but to tremble alſo, <hi>We know who thou art Jeſus the Sonne of God, art thou come to torment us before the time,</hi> Matt. 8 29.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The Devill for number is greater in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Generation then Jeſus Chriſt is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. and all the world wondered and followed the beaſt, and power was given him over every kindred Tongue and Nation, verſe 3.7. the Saints of God did not follow him verſe the eighth.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The Devill is a particular power or ſpirit above all Devills that are in darkeneſſe. If power were one, then it cannot be many, but we prove that there are many powers, they are called Angels, <hi>Jua</hi> 6. <hi>Job</hi> 4. the Devill ſaid that his name was Legion, hee is called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the chiefe or Prince of Devills, he is called Dragon <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. Whereſoever any wickedneſſe is, there he is, for as his beeing doth exceede the being of other Creatures, ſo his wickedneſſe and corruption doth exceede all others too the nature of the Devill is the fountaine of all evills, it is the throne and top of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all the ſinnes and abominations that are committed by all perſons in this world, are but as ſo many ſtreames
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:113757:54"/>flowing from this fountaine, the Devill is called the father of lyes, the ſeede of ſinne in the bowels of the Devill is abſolutely begotten by the Devill, he is the firſt inventer of that worke, he is called the old Serpent, a murtherer from the beginning, the firſt of lyers, we muſt not underſtand, that though the Devill be the father and fountaine of all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that therefore he ſhall be condemned for the ſins of men, God is Juſt and Righteous in the condemnation not only of men but of Devills too, he doth not condemne man for the ſin of the Devill, neither doth he condemne one Angel for the ſin of another, and although there was one who was the firſt beginner of all, and by that greatneſſe which he had, came to be King over all, yet we muſt know that God never laid the ſin of other Angels, to the charge of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> nor the ſinne of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> he never laid to the charge of other Angels, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.12. <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.27. though the Devill is the father and fountaine of all ſinne, yet it is not hee that doth act and commit all, it is true, that there is no ſinne committed upon the face of the whole Earth, but the Devill hath ſome hand or other, either firſt or laſt in that ſinne, the Devill and the heart of man are both one, in one action, not both one power or ſubſtance, but too ſeverall diſtinct powers, both one in action, as a thouſand men may be all one in the murthering of one man, and yet remaine ſo many ſeverall diſtinct perſons as they were before, they have all one minde in that worke, which cauſeth ſuch a oneneſſe and union to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſo it is the will of man to commit ſin, and it is the will and minde of the Devill alſo, that that ſin ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Divell he tempts, man he acts, ſo that there are two works united in one, and yet in the greateſt neereneſſe betwixt man &amp; the devill as they remain diſtinct in ſubſtance, ſo alſo in action now the ſins of men, ſo far as it is their own for which they ſhall be condemned is not the Devills, nor never ſhall be laid to his charge, when a man doth commit Fornication, or Uncleanneſſe, the devil doth not commit &amp; do that, yet he hath a hand in that, it could not be committed without the help and aſſiſtance of the Devill, now by all this you may ſee what a mighty ſpirit, and what a great hard worker the Devill is.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:113757:55"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſervation,</hi> whereſoever any wickedneſſe is, there the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is, <hi>Job</hi> 1.7 and that for theſe two Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the devill had not power to bee at once in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this world, then hee could not devoure and delude in ſuch a great meaſure as hee doth; It would be a long tedious piece of work for the devill to go by degrees, firſt to one heart, and there to ſtay untill hee had finiſhed all his wickedneſſe,
<note place="margin">Whatſoever the devill is, that is his eſſence, but the power of the devill in one or many reſpects in one perſon, or in a thouſand, is not whatſoever the devill is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the devill, is not the eſſence of him.</note> and then go to another; no, he can, and is by his power in all hearts at once, where Jeſus Chriſt in the ſpirit is not, yet we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that every perſon hath an evill or a good Angell waiting upon him, yet there is no Angell in darkneſſe, but doth that work which hee is the chiefe and principall agent in; I doe not ſay that the perſon of the devill is at once in all hearts, that is ſo great, that one, nor all hearts in his kingdome cannot comprehend, but the devill is every where by his power, by his temptations, by his ſervants, and evill inſtruments which doe obey his will, now the power of the devill in one or in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects is not the perſon of the devill, that is, tis not his eſſence or beeing, but an appearance of his beeing, and thus much for the firſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this, all ſin flowes from the devill, therefore whereſoever that is, there hee is, a corrupted fountain doth ſend forth corrupted ſtreames, now whereſoever the ſtream is, there the Fountain is: the Fountain is there in part, and in appearance, but not in eſſence, now were it not for this the ſtream would ceaſe to bee, or if the Fountain in ſome reſpects were not there, it could not bee, whereſoever the fire is, there heart is, for that is its nature and property; and whereſoever the heat is, there the fire is, take away the fire and the heat ceaſes to bee, now the fire is not where the heat is in its being, but in part, and in appearance, whereſoever the devill is, there ſin muſt needs bee, unleſſe hee could ceaſe from action, ſo whereſoever any evill is, there the devill is in one reſpect or other, take away the devill and ſin ceaſes to bee, if the devill could leave tempting, deluding, and blinding the eyes, and hearts of men, men would then leave ſinning. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, that whereſoever Ignorance reignes, there reignes ſin, and whereſoever ſin reignes, there the devill rules; now it is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:113757:55"/>impoſſible for the devill to rule where he is not, it is unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that ſin ſhould bee where the devill is</p>
               <p n="10">10. The devill is not onely the fountain of all corruption in all hearts, but is in his ſelf, a particular power and ſpirituall wickedneſſe, that is, though hee is ſo great in being, yet hee is a particular being, and though his nature doth comprehend ſuch an Ocean of filthineſſe, yet is all this filthineſſe the devils own, and not anothers, this great power, I doe not ſay the corruption thereof is God in its originall; for when God firſt created this being, it had not this name, the name devill, nor the nature neither, the devill was a good Angell, and was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and happy, for the time that hee continued in that eſtate wherein he was firſt created, but hee together with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, kept not their firſt ſtanding, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and ſo were caſt down into hell, to be kept unto damnation, <hi>Jude</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>This power is God in two reſpect; firſt, conſider it in its firſt originall; ſecondly, it is God in his appearance.</p>
               <p>For, hee hath therefore created him, that by him he might manifeſt his power and diſcover the greatneſſe of his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty unto all creatures.</p>
               <p>There be ſome affirm, that whereſoever Gods power is, there alſo his eſſence is, for his power is his eſſence; Againe, others ſay, that the devill is the aire, from this Scripture, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 22 and the breath that is in mans body, hee proves the latter by the former, if the devill bee the aire, ſaith he, man doth breathe in and breathe out the aire, and in this reſpect, hee doth breathe in and breathe out the devill, theſe juggling counterfeits, by theſe expreſſions, doe deny the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, I ſhall ground this upon this Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. for this purpoſe was made manifeſt that of God, that hee might loſe the works of the devill; the propoſition is this:</p>
               <p>The end of God, manifeſt in the fleſh (was) to looſe the works of the devill, I ſhall bring one Scripture to ſhew what is here meant by looſing the works of the devill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. that that is here called looſing the works of the devill, is there called the deſtruction of the devill, it is not as the <hi>Familiſts</hi> would have it, when they ſpeak of ſelf-denyall that God muſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:113757:56"/>bee all and the creature nothing, that the created forme, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſubſtance of the devill was deſtroyed, in reſpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſubſiſting, for they hold that all created things muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and come to nothing, that God may be all, now if the devill bee thus deſtroyed, then is not Chriſt come in the fleſh, and if Chriſt bee not come in the fleſh, then his death is made void, for hee cannot ſuffer that never had a beeing, and the Reſurrection, Aſcention, Interceſſion, and comming of Chriſt to judgement, muſt needs be nothing but a meere phantaſie, and imagination, and if this be ſo, then nothing ſhall remain but the God-head and if nothing ſhall continue but God, then there is but one ſpirit in the world, and if there bee but one ſpirit in the world, then all things muſt needs be the act of God, and if all things bee the act of God, then the higheſt perfection that ever man ſhall injoy, hee ſhall injoy in this life.</p>
               <p>My Argument to prove that he that denies this, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill hath a beeing, denies the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, is this, whoſoever denies the work that Jeſus Chriſt came to doe, denies Chriſt himſelf, but to ſay that Chriſt came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the beeing and ſubſtance of the devill, a work which hee came not to doe, is to deny the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh; I ſhall give one inſtance to prove this, hee that denies that to bee God, which in truth is God, he denies the beeing of God himſelf, but he that holds that there is but one ſpirit or life in all creatures, which is the true God, beſides which there is no other, hee affirmes God to be that which in truth he is not; Therefore he denies the beeing of God himſelf, ſo he that affirmes that to be the work of Chriſt, which in truth is not, he denies the comming and beeing of Chriſt himſelfe, but he that ſaith, that the end of Chriſt by his comming, was to deſtroy the very beeing of the devill, he affirmes that Chriſt came to do that work which he hath not done, nor never will doe, therefore thus to ſpeak is to deny the comming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> What is meant by theſe words, <hi>Deſtroy him, that had the power of death, that is the devill?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To deſtroy him, is not meant to deſtroy the devill in his beeing, but the devill in his enterprizes, Chriſt by his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:113757:56"/>croſſe, dealt by the Devill, as God did by the Spaniſh Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which all the purpoſes and plots of the enemie were drawne up to one head,
<note place="margin">Simil.</note> the execution thereof being ſet on foote all their hearts were linckt together in one as their ſhips were, and all inſtruments being ready, making full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt to conquour and deſtroy all that was before them, God for the preſervation of his people, raiſed up an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to defeate the enemie in the heighth of their villainy, by which all their ſhips bonds, purpoſes, reſolutions, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and determinations, were all looſed, deſtroyed, ſpoyled, and captivated, and the Kingdome ſaved and delivered in a miraculous manner from ſuch a ſudden ruine and cruell over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, wee know that they were all deſtroyed, though not all ſlaine.</p>
               <p>The plot of the Devill from the beginning, and all his purpoſes and reſolutions, concerning the totall overthrow of <hi>Sion</hi> was drawne up to one head, the Devill and all the inſtruments of Hell and this world, had made all things ready for execution, indevouring to bring a ſuddaine ruine and perpetuall overthrow to the kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt by his comming, when the Devill was in the prime of his ſtrength, when he had gotten almoſt to the top of all his deſires, I ſay that Jeſus Chriſt by ſuffering for ſinners, by ſatisfying Gods Juſtice, by reconciling God and man toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpoyled, looſed, captivated and deſtroyed the Devill, and all his aſſiſtance, in all their purpoſes, councels, and preparations that he had made, and delivered all the Saints from bondage, darkeneſſe, death and thraldome, which they were in under the Law, and brought life and immortality to light thorow the Goſpell. The ſimilitude is full and cleare, the difference is, that Gods worke by Chriſt in the redemption and ſalvation of the world, was more excellent and exceeding glorious then this outward deliverance by man, from an outward calamitie. I do not bring this only to compaire the worke of God in our outward deliverance to his worke in our ſpirituall, but I bring it to prove that Chriſt by his comming hath deſtroyed the workes of the Devill, as God deſtroyed the divices of theſe enemies in that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:113757:57"/>exploite which they had in hand, that as God defeated them by cauſing their owne purpoſes to be their own confuſion, ſo God by Chriſt, ſpoyled and deſtroyed, not the Devill in his ſubſtance, but in all his workes, purpoſes, and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the power of his Death and Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>I ſhall further Diſcover the Devill to you by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations. Firſt, the Devill is an enemy to the name of God, I ſhall prove it by theſe arguments, firſt whatſoever is not Spiritually ſubject and obedient unto the command of God, is an enemie to his name, for a perſons obedience to Gods Commandements, is that by which the name of God is glorified and exalted, but the Devill is not ſpiritually ſubject and obedient to the Commandements of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt needs be an enemie to his name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſpirit that would exalt himſelfe ſo as, that by his inventions he would be equall with God, that ſpirit in ſo doing is an enemie to his name, but the Devills deſire was, and ſtill is to exalt himſelfe ſo as that by his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he would be equall with God, therefore the Devill is an enemie to the name of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that ſpirit that doth indevour to deſtroy all the decrees and workes of God concerning the Redemption and Salvation of man, which are for the glory of his name, that ſpirit is an enemie to his name, but the Devill hath and ſtill doth indevour to Annihilate and make voide all the Decrees and Workes of God, concerning the Redemption and Salvation of the world, therefore, the Devill is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the name of God.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, that ſpirit whoſe nature, is contrary to the nature of God, that perſon muſt needs be an enemie to the name of God, but the nature of the devill is in an unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable meaſure contrary to the nature of God, therefore the Devill cannot be any other then an enemie to God, the Scriptures to prove theſe arguments are theſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.7.8.9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1.2.3.4.5.14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.3.6.8.9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.3.4. <hi>Matt.</hi> 2.16.20. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Ioh</hi> 8.48.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Devill is an enemie to the nature of God, I prove it thus, firſt, that that is not or hath not the nature
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:113757:57"/>of God in it, in one reſpect or other, he muſt needs be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it, for that which is not light, or which light is not in, that muſt needs be darkeneſſe and ſo conſequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it.</p>
               <p>But the devill is not the light, nor is not in this reſpect in the light, therefore he muſt needs be an enemy to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which any perſon ſeeks continually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and devoure, that he cannot at that time countenance and bee a friend too, but the continuall practice of the devill is, how and by what meanes he may devoure and deſtroy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God in a Chriſtian, therefore he is an enemy to it, the joy of the devill, if he have any is, that he by his might and power, being premitted, can deface the Image of God, and hinder the workings of the divine nature in the perſon of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The deſire of the devill is, that he might, never to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, be made partakers of the divine nature, nor ever be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or reconciled to God, this is a <hi>Maxime</hi> in Divinity, that a true and reall deſire of Grace, is Grace, the Devill cannot have a ſpirituall deſire to be united to God, but that deſire muſt in the riſe of it, be produced by his union with God; your <hi>Familiſticall Infants,</hi> I mean thoſe of the vaile, doe ſay, that all things without exception are reconciled from this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and the like, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. Now if all things be, then the devill is, if this be true then this abſurdity muſt needs follow, if the devill be reconciled, then Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to reconcile that which by his croſſe was totally captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deſtroyed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If this bee true, then the Apoſtle doth ſay that in one place, which hee denies in another, compare <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. with <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. Now if they ſay that the Scriptures are falſe, and that there is no devill, they ſpeak that that their fathers in a better, ſubtiller way have ſpoken before them, therefore they may ſave themſelves a labour.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>A Deſcription of the Spirit of man.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALthough this be a difficult point, to ſhow what the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man is, and a thing that I intend not to meddle with, in that way that many do, yet give me leave to deſcribe unto you what the ſpirit of man is; it is deſcribed in the Word of God, therefore I make bold to give a definition of it, God hath carryed my ſpirit through algreater and harder work then this is.</p>
               <p>There be theſe opinions of the ſpirit of man, one is, that it is mortall, and ſhall dye and periſh with the body; others ſay that it ſhall dye with the body but ſhall bee raiſed again at the laſt day; others ſay that it is God, God in his eſſence, as for this laſt ſort I have made it the principall part of my diſcourſe to ſhow the myſterious Antichriſtian falſhood thereof; and for the further confutation hereof, I ſhall goe on in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the ſpirit of man.</p>
               <p>I deſire to keep cloſe to the rule, and I think this to bee the ſureſt way to take to, that no man may winde and baffle mee out in what I ſhall ſay and then wee ſhall ſee the blaſphemy of theſe Doctrines to appeare nakedly to our view, conſider of and lay to heart what I ſhall ſay to you, for I think that I ſhall have many witneſſes and teſtimonies on my ſide, when I have done, I ſhall deſcribe the ſpirit of man to you by theſe queries; the firſt Inquiery is this, what is this ſpirit in its ſelf? ſecondly in its action.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The ſpirit of man was created and received a beeing, which it had not before, by the Word of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Hee was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not:</hi> the world was not finiſhed before the ſpirit of man was made, for the ſpirit of man was one of thoſe works that God made in the creation, God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in man, in the face of man, the breath of life, and man became a living ſoule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. The firſt man was made (obſerve that expreſſion,) a living ſoule, it had a beginning,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113757:58"/>God had ordained that it ſhould bee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. But it had not a reall ſubſtance and beeing, before it was created, all things are eternall in reference to the purpoſe of God, but nothing is eternall in reference to it ſelf, nothing was really neither in reſpect of it ſelf, as it was in the creation; Gods purpoſe was that it ſhould bee one of his works in the creation.</p>
               <p>Some doe conceive that becauſe it was, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſtill is, ſuch a great and glorious beeing, therefore it muſt needs be, not onely of, but the eſſence, or God himſelf, for when God breathed in <hi>Adam</hi> the breach of life, hee then did breathe in himſelfe, and could breathe in no leſſe then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, we acknowledge it was made by the Power, Spirit and Word of God in its creation, yea, and we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge further, that it is not onely by the power of God, but of the power, and is the power of God, wee dare not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any thing becauſe of our imaginations, for they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, but wee are bold to affirm and contend earneſtly for that that God hath revealed unto us by his Word and Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.22. ver. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is ſaid by ſome, that if we will prove that the ſpirit of man is the power of God, which indeed we doe, here is our warrant, it is of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. laſt. <hi>Of him are all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, It is of God, once have I ſaid it, ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> yea twice, <hi>That power belongs to God;</hi> it is ſuck a thing as cannot be attributed to any being, ſo as to God, no man can challenge it, and ſay, that power in the leaſt meaſure belongs to me, no man hath power of himſelfe, either to be, or not to bee, either this or that, rich or poore, a King or a Begger, to live or dye, to walk or refrain from walking, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>There is no power but of God,</hi> now thus farre we can goe and no farther, not in a way of truth, modeſty, and ſafety, unleſſe we will make our ſelves of the number of them, or compare our ſelves to them that praiſe themſelves, ſaying, that no man can Preach ſuch ſtrange, high, care, divine myſteries as they can.</p>
               <p>He that is baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, knows all things by the ſame light that God doth, but this is not high enough,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113757:59"/>this may be plainly ſeen within the Scriptures, he knows all things as God doth, nay a little higher, he that doth ſubmit to them, to God, may be made and called, and ſo bee divine and God; This is myſticall Divinity, that none can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand but themſelves, deifyed men, therefore they live above the Moon, for they live in the Sun, but if we will prove what was ſaid before, they will diſprove us by this that ſuch a God is not worth any thing (I am aſhamed to expreſſe the very word) whoſe eſſence is not where his power is; well, what I have ſaid wee have proved, and will acknowledge, but not in every reſpect, for in ſome reſpects, it is an Antichriſtian ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemy, Ile ſpeak but a word, it being already ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of man is God, and God is the life of man, God is all things, and all things are God, not in his eſſence but in his appearance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the ſpirit of man be God, then why is it ſaid that God made it, or that man became ſuch a thing? God cannot be made, he is without beginning, blot out that Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the ſpirit of man be God, then he did know all things ſenſibly and infinitely, and did doe all things, and ſtill doth know all ſecrets both in heaven and earth, in grace and in nature.</p>
               <p>O myſticall Antichriſt, prethee tell me one thing, doe not be found to be a lyer in every word, doſt thou know really and abſolutely, that thou thy ſelfe art God, and knoweſt all things as he doth? then tell me this, what diddeſt thou doe? what was thy imployment and work from all eternity? canſt thou not tell? If thou art God thou canſt not forget thy ſelf, nor be ignorant of thy ſelf, before thou didſt appeare in this Organ or viſible forme, which before was hid within thy ſelf in ſilence and darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt anſwer me with this word, that he, that is the thing cannot ſpeak it but if any deſire to know it, let him expect untill hee bee the thing.</p>
               <p>This is a poore come off, is not God as infinite in his Word, as he is in his minde? obſerve that.</p>
               <p>Againe, if thou art God, why doeſt thou not in thy preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:113757:59"/>and writing, diſcover unto thy members the ſecrets of all hearts, thou knoweſt not what I am nowdoing againſt thee, thou knoweſt not how long thou ſhalt live, nor how ſoone thou ſhalt die.</p>
               <p>Againe, if thy Spirit be God, ſhow me all things in the path of nature, canſt thou number the Starres, and call them all by their names? Canſt thou number the ſands of the ſea, and count the meaſure of the Waters to a drop? Canſt thou cover thy ſelfe with Darkeneſſe, and make the thicke darkeneſſe thy Pavillion? doth the eyes of all Creatures waite upon thee, and doſt thou give them their meate in due ſeaſon, it is time to ſtop? If thou canſt, come forth and anſwer? If not, Why doſt thou ſo exalt thy ſelfe, ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and without meaſure blaſpheme the Almighty,</p>
               <p>The Spirit of man is not the Eſſence, but it is God in the appearance of his power, and the power or ſpirit of man is God in that appearance.</p>
               <p>When God made man, and put a ſpirit into him, he did put in or goe into man himſelfe, but he did not put in, or goe in himſelfe, in his Eſſence, but in the manifeſtation and diſcovery of his Eſſence; and ſo he appeared in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in man after another manner, ſetting up a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light and manifeſtation of himſelf, than he did in all other Creatures beſides, except the good Angels; <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that the ſpirit of a man is the Candle of the Lord, it is not the Lord in his beeing, for light and darkneſſe are both alike to him.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of man is not, in the courſe of nature, a light to the Lord, to diſcover any thing to him, but it is the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord, ſet up by him in the bodies of men, by which light, they come to know God, and to know all things that hee hath decreed, that by that light ſhall be revealed unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. For as much, as may be knowne of God was manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them, now if that light had bin able to carry them forth, into a ſpirituallity in all things, that as they knew God, ſo they might glorifie him as God, and not become vaine in their imaginations, and ſo turne not, nor make uſe of that knowledge which they had of God, to the exaltation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:113757:60"/>and ſetting up of that, that was not God, they had bin ſaved, <hi>verſe</hi> 20.21.22.23.24.25. but that light was not ſufficient for ſuch a worke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſpirit of man is of, thorow, and to God, that is, as he is the Ordainer, Creator, Governour, and Upholder thereof, ſurely, there muſt needs be a wonderfull appearance of God, in all this, and this muſt needs be God in a glorious appearance or diſcovery of himſelfe in man, and yet his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is not the nature life and ſpirit of man, a wonderfull appearance of God in man, to give and meaſure out into his Spirit, ſo much power and glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſpirit of man as it came forth in its firſt eſtate, out of the hands of God, was the ſweeteſt and the excellenteſt of all Creatures in this world, and was heire of all things, being very frequent in Communion with God, now the ſame ſpirit that he had then, he never loſt, for then he would have ceaſed from his being, and therefore all men have ſuch a ſpirit as then God gave unto <hi>Adam,</hi> that which he loſt by falling, was that good, peaceable, holy and glorious condition wherein he ſtood with God, this hee loſt, both for himſelfe and his poſterity, in the day that thou eateſt thereof, in dying thou ſhalt ſurely dye, now if by dying the Lord had meant, to take away his Spirit in the being of it, then how comes it to paſſe that he lived ſo long, knew his wife, and increaſed in his Generation, by which meanes we come now to have a being in the world, what cunning Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Poeticall, Phyloſopher is there, that can winde us out of any of theſe truths.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If <hi>Adam</hi> loſt his ſpirit, and it was not one and the ſame with ours, then did God raiſe up another contrary Generation in the World, and then what kind of Death is that which he did, and we doe now ſuffer, if that ſpirit was deſtroyed in the being of it then it never after felt, or could be any wayes capable or ſenſible,
<note place="margin">See the booke Intituled Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected.</note> either of a condition of Joy, or torment, but that, that we call the loſſe and fall of man, that Antichriſt, ſaith, is nothing elſe but God in an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of darkeneſſe, for the ſinnes cauſe, and for the good of the man, that God and man had made, that hee might
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:113757:60"/>take an occaſion by this darkeneſſe and obſcure appearance, to manifeſt himſelfe to, and in the man, in all his Eſſentiall glory, Anſwer, man by his fall inſtead of bringing Death to himſelfe and to his poſterity, by this meanes he brought life and immortality, the God-head and the Eſſence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if all this be true, it is time I thinke, to throw away the Scriptures, in the beginning God made man Righteous, but he hath found out many inventions <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> That light is a pure ſimple naked and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall faith, Reſiding in the crowne of the of the ſoule, and beholds God without any meane, pag. 115. As if he ſhould ſay, that the ſoule, by a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall faith, beholds God, without a Mediator, for, ſaith he, nothing is but Gods will. pag. 70. the will of God is God himſelfe, therefore, nothing is but it, pag. 71. line 14. and that this is a Divine truth according to the Scriptures, he turnes you to the firſt chapter, and there you ſhall ſee one lye proved to be a truth by another, if this be a trueth it is Impoſſible that there ſhould be any Mediator, and if this be true then the ſoule is God, and ſo God doth behold himſelfe without any meane.</note> the ſpirit of man is a particular ſubſtance and power; beſides the Eſſence of God, yet there is not another Eſſence or God-head beſides that one, who is Infinite and Eternall, all ſpirits whatſoever are ſo many particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall powers, all powers, whatſoever are one in their Originall, but many in reference to their particular beings; if any man hath lockt himſelfe up in ſecret, and is very loath to come forth to ſhow himſelfe plainly to the pooreſt capacity, whether he be for Chriſt or for Antichriſt, yet let him now come forth to helpe us againſt the mighty, or to helpe the mighty againſt <hi>Jehovah;</hi> I will prove this truth to you by the Scripture and by Reaſon too.</p>
               <p>Which is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. <hi>At the right hand of God, gone into Heaven, unto whom the Angels, Powers and might are ſubject,</hi> here is included in this, all the ſpirits that are both in Heaven and Earth, now I prove that they are perfect particular powers and beings beſides God, the power of God in the God-head is God, and it is not compounded of parts and degrees, but the power of God, in the ſeverall appearances of God, is not the life and being of him, but is the life and being of Angels and men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the power of God, in his Eſſence cannot be made or brought into ſubjection, under Jeſus Chriſt, but
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113757:61"/>the power of God in his ſeverall appearances are, for God hath ſo exalted the Lord Jeſus, that all Creatures both men and Angels are made ſubject to him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.9.10. But God cannot be made or brought under ſubjection to God, as theſe Angels powers and mights were; Againe,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There cannot be a higher confuſion, or A greater contradiction imagined and expreſſed by the heart and tongue of man, then this, to thinke that God, ſhould ever bow downe to the Lord Jeſus, God in his Eſſence is the bleſſed Trinity, in his perſon hee is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, take away a mans, or an Angels power from him, and what is he? Againe,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is impoſſible that ever God in his power, ſhould be ſpoyled, by the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. and hath ſpoyled principalities and powers, and hath made a ſhew of them openly, and hath triumphed over them in the ſame croſſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God had ordained and created theſe inviſible powers for this one maine end, that Chriſt in his croſſe might ſpoyle, and triumph over them, for the Everlaſting glory and exaltation of his owne name, <hi>The ſeede of the woman ſhall breake the Serpents head,</hi> Gen.</p>
               <p>When hath ever any Army, bin ſo exalted in glory as at that time, when they can by one thouſand, bring into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and to confuſion many thouſands?</p>
               <p>This is the unſpeakeable glory of the Lord Jeſus, that he can bring forth from under a poore low appearance on the croſſe, ſuch a mighty and Infinite power and glory, ſo as to ſpoyle, to pull downe, and lay in the duſt, all the glory of this world, thus much for a certaine truth is clearely held forth in the Word. Againe,</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The ſpirit of a man hath many faculties, that goes, to the making up of a compleat ſpirit, and theſe had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and were Created, and ſo were all powers both in Heaven and Earth, for by him were all things created, which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, things viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:113757:61"/>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. I could give you a large Deſcription of the will of a man, what an irreſiſtable power it is, untill that power that made it, doe, or is pleaſed to perſwade and allure it, there is no compelling of it, will that is forced is not will, ſo alſo, the thoughts of a man, how can hee with his thoughts, ſoare up and down, and incompaſſe heaven and earth, and bring home tydings of that which the tongue is never able to expreſſe, nor indeed the whole heart able to conceive of, or comprehend, the devill, as I ſaid before, of all creatures, is the greateſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is in this world, but a Chriſtian in the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus, is a power above the devill, in a greater meaſure then the devill is in power above all creatures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37, 38. Hee onely is able to trample upon the devill, <hi>James</hi> 4.7. And by Faith to overcome this world, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.4. A Chriſtian in power is next unto Chriſt, the devill is next unto a Chriſtian, Antichriſt in power, is next unto the devill, and a naturall man next unto Antichriſt, ſo a man in his affections is very ſtrong and mighty, who is it, or what is it, that can take off the minde of a man from that which he hath affection to, all the powers that are in the ſoule are never in a Joynte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, nor are ever knit in a ſtronger union, then when they are upon one thing, met together in a band of love.</p>
               <p>What is that that makes a man a monſter in nature, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his limbes and joynts are not according to the courſe of nature? what is the cauſe why ſome men are fooliſh, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void of Reaſon, but, becauſe their ſpirits are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that common frame, which uſually the generation of the Sons of men are in? the continuall action of mans heart, is to live and move in the devill; to have his heart ſo ſet upon himſelf and the things of this world, that all created powers in Heaven and Earth are not able to take it off, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. what is that that makes men to bee ſo reſolute, ſo poſitive, and wilfull in all Hereſies, Opinions, Diſputations, and Works whatſoever, but becauſe that theſe three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall powers in their ſpirits, are deluded and captivated by the god of this world.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The life and ſpirit of man is not the winde in the Aire, nor the breath that is in mans body.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:113757:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection,</hi> The ſpirit is a reaſonable creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The winde is reaſonable in reference to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in compariſon of man it is not; Man is falne down into everlaſting miſery, and raiſed up again into everlaſting glory, doth the winde know or underſtand this?</p>
               <p>Again, The breath onely is not the ſpirit, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The breath is viſible, and may bee ſeen, but the ſpirit is inviſible and cannot be ſeen, therefore it cannot be the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The breath that is in man, and the breath of a beaſt are both one, under ſome conſiderations: firſt, they are both one in their originall. Secondly, They are both one in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and viſible appearance; Laſtly, They are both one in their end, conſider this, firſt, how God hath united himſelfe to all his works, by which they come to be, and to ſubſiſt in their beeing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider how God hath united one work to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yet notwithſtanding this union, they remain ſeverall and diſtinct in their beeings natures, motions, and poſſeſſions, the beeing of a Beaſt is not the beeing of man, the nature of a beaſt is not the nature of Man, the motion of a Beaſt is not the motion of Man, that which a beaſt hath poſſeſſion of, that is not, nor cannot be the inward, internall eternall poſſeſſions of men, a Beaſt knows his own kinde from a man, this is not mans motion, nor the motion of breath, therefore that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the ſpirit. Thus much for a Deſcription of God, of Angels and men.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113757:62"/>when a man out of that light and knowledge which hee hath of God, doth make a large acknowledgement of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, a man that doth delight to know God in Jeſus Chriſt, and doth ſeek him daily, for ſuch a man to fall away thus, he doth commit that ſin which ſhall never bee forgiven, neither ſhall there ever be any mercy for that man in this world or that to come, the ſins I ſhall ſumme up in theſe ſeverall expreſſions; When a man ſhall make uſe of all that light, knowledge, and ſtrength which formerly hee hath received, in a willfull way, to this end, that now by all this, he doth deny the comming of Jeſus Chriſt in the fleſh, for a man that hath known Chriſt by the light of the ſpirit, and hath received a taſte of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, for ſuch a man, with a good will and delight, purpoſely againſt his conſcience, againſt the ſtrivings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſpirit, out of a hatred and malice againſt him and his members, for ſuch a man to deny Chriſt in his comming, to undervalue him, to laugh and make a ſcorn or jeer of the ſpirit, in all that it ſaith in the Scriptures, for a man to mock at the ſervants of Chriſt; when they write, diſpute, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, for that Faith that was once given and cannot be given again, the Word ſaith, that it is impoſſible that ſuch a man ſhould be renewed again by repentance, ſeeing they crucifie again to themſelves the Son of God, and make a mock of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 56. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12 45. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.2, 3.</p>
               <p>O Antichriſt, what doſt thou ſay to this? art thou able to come forth and confirme thy Doctrine, by ſignes and lying wonders, canſt thou by thy turning of Divinity into Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and Phyloſophy into Divinity, and ſo make up one great myſtery of Iniquity, draw away the third part of the Starres of Heaven, the third part of Profeſſours after thee, well this may be, thy number increaſeth apace, but thoſe that are elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall never fall, we doe look for what we already ſee, for trying, apoſtatating, and back-ſliding times, but bee of good comfort, whoſoever thou art that haſte but as much Faith in, and love to a particular crucified Jeſus, as a grain of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds, thou ſhalt never fall off for ever, from thy communion with God in the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 38. nothing ſhall be ever able to make a ſeparation betwixt thee and thy God.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:113757:63"/>
               <p>But ſome may object and ſay, to what end doe I thus labour to diſcover the ſpirit of the Devill, and of Man, and the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Spirit; wherein doth this deſcribe and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that myſticall miſchievous Antichriſt, whoſe Doctrines you undertake to overthrow by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> By diſcovering and deſcribing the devill, I prove and beare record to many truths, and by proving and bearing witneſſe to the truth, that it is the truth; I condemne many Doctrines as being falſe, untrue, and not of God, but ſuch as would if it were poſſible, blot out the true knowledge and remembrance of the true God, from the midſt amongſt us; there be theſe generall Doctrines, and particular hereticall parts, which are diſcovered to be no other, then the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and lies of blaſphemous lying ſpirits, the Familiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Doctrines in generall which are deſcribed and confuted by the diſcovery or deſcription of the Devill are theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, It weakens and annihilates this Doctrine, <hi>viz,</hi> That there is but one ſpirit in the world, and that is eſſentially God, if the Devill have a beeing, as the Scriptures declare he hath, than there are two ſpirits in the world, and if there be two ſpirits, then of neceſſity one of them cannot be abſolutely and eſſentially God, unleſſe we will acknowledge two Gods; now if there be ſuch a beeing or ſpirit, which is abſolutely evill, and ſo a Devill abſolutely; and really, then this Doctrine is falſe which acknowledges but one ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Again, If there be no devill, as they in all their writings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten affirme there is not, then is there no God neither, and this I prove by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Hee that willingly denies God in one reſpect, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies him in all, but this Doctrine doth deny God to be in this reſpect, under this one maine conſideration; Therefore it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies God under all conſiderations, I ſhall explicate this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thus, he that denies the Workes of God, he denies God himſelf, but this ſpirit will not acknowledge a devill, who is one of Gods Works in reference to the Creation, it will not acknowledge that ever there was ſuch a beeing or ſpirit, ſuch a work or creature, as he is whom we call by ſuch a name, therefore in denying him who is one of the works of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113757:63"/>God, yea, the chiefeſt of his wayes, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, they deny God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Every work or creature that was, or ever ſhall bee created, is an appearance of God, my Argument is this, hee that denies any of Gods works, he denies the appearances and diſcoveries of God himſelf, but this Doctrine doth deny God in reſpect of his creatures, which are ſo many diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of him, therefore it denies God himſelf, he that denies any one beam of the Sun, and will not acknowledge it to bee the light thereof, he denies the Sun it ſelf, for as ſure as the Sun is, ſo ſure is it that all its beames are its own proper light, and there cannot bee any diviſion made, unleſſe men will ſay, that it is not in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hee that denies all the works of God, by him God is not acknowledged, but this Doctrine doth deny all Gods Workes therefore it denies God himſelf, all creatures doe declare this Truth, that God is, now if all creatures which doe diſcover this, that God is, are not, then God is not, if that which in truth diſcovers God to bee, <hi>is not,</hi> then God, who is really diſcovered to bee, by theſe creatures which he hath created, <hi>(is not.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that will not acknowledge that to bee a creature, which in truth is a creature, he denies all creatures, and holds that nothing is but God and his will,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bright Star.</hi> Theologia.</note> he that denies <hi>Belzebub</hi> to bee, who is the prince of Devills, he denies all the devills that are in hell, and hell it ſelf, now if there be no evill Angels, then are there good ones, for theſe Angels which are now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, were once good, and if the Scriptures which ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, be not a truth, then is no thing a truth that it ſpeaks of, and then this damnable Paradox ſtands firme, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is nothing in the creature, which is not the Creator, nothing in the Creator, that is not God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He that denies him that is begotten,
<note place="margin">Bright Star.</note> denies him alſo that doth beget, but this Doctrine doth deny Chriſt to be who is begotten of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. Therefore it denies God himſelf, I prove it thus, the devill tempted our firſt Parents, and they obeyed, and ſo were condemned, and upon this Chriſt was promiſed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:113757:64"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Now if the devill was not, how could hee tempt, if the devill never tempted, then man never ſinned, if man never ſinned, then Chriſt was not promiſed, if Chriſt was not promiſed, then he never appeared, if Chriſt never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, then he never dyed, was not raiſed, nor never aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if all this be true, then you that have any knowledge of Chriſt, any relation to Chriſt, any fellowſhop with him in the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1. Judge for I appeale to you all, of all different opinions whatſoever; I ſay, judge whether this doth acknowledge any God, but what is in the creature, and ſo no God at all, and this is the firſt generall Doctrine, and ſome particular parts together with it, which is deſcribed and confuted by a deſcription of the devill, and the Spirit of man; the ſecond generall that is deſcribed and confuted by a deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the devill, the ſpirit of man, and the ſin againſt the Holy Spirit, is this, that all the abominations of men and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills are the act of the Spirit of God; now if there bee two ſpirits, then there are two diſtinct actours two different works, all which cannot be the act of God; The third Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and confuted is this, that nothing ſhall remain but the god-head, their meaning is, that this world ſhall bee eternall in its generation, this preſent ſucceſſion of ages and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall never end, for God is all things, and all things are God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> Theologia.</note> now if it be a Truth, that there are more ſpirits then one, then this is true, that they ſhall all come to judgement, they ſhall appeare before God to receive an everlaſting portion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of life or death, joy or torment, glory or ſhame, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Cor</hi> 15. 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4 13, 14, 15 16, 17. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. even according as they are ordained, according as they have walked; The fourth and laſt generall is this, that perfection is in this life, their meaning is, that there is no perfection at all,
<note place="margin">Divinity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected. <hi>Bright Starr,</hi> Pag. 77.78. lin. 13. pag. 79. l. 13 Theologia pag. 25. pag. 74. pag. 87. l. 12. pag. 37.</note> for they define perfection to be God himſelf, now if the devill be, then hee is a creature, if he be a creature, then all creatures cannot obtain perfection here, for the devill was charged with folly ever ſince the beginning, and delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to chaines of darkneſſe, to bee kept unto damnation, <hi>Iude.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Again, If the Scripture be a truth, then all men ſhall not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113757:64"/>be ſaved, and thoſe that ſhall, yet in this life, they have but a part of that which they ſhall injoy hereafter 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4 13, 14, 15, 16. Now I leave the reſt for you to conſider of.</p>

               <p>I Have a word or two to ſpeak, and that is, to a publick Preacher, to a private Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>You that are famous for preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, deliver not your mindes in ſuch a way of myſterious obſcurity, ſo as that not ten in a hundred can underſtand your meanings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be for Chriſt or Antichriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Condiſcend and ſtoop down without thinking it to be a diſparagement to you, to the pooreſt weakeſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. Chap. 1 14. Take heed of preaching your ſelves and your own words to the people, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the confirmation and comfort of the members of Chriſt, by your preaching of Chriſt, for the confounding of the hopes of Antichriſt; clear your ſelves from thoſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, Familiſticall Reproaches and aſperſions, that are caſt upon you, and upon that truth that you deliver, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2. to all Chriſtians that are not ſo publique in your trying and examining of all Religions, Doctrines, Spirits, and opinions whatſoever, be ſure to hold faſt a particular crucified Jeſus, 1 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 5.21. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, doe not beleeve nor put confidence in any ſpirit or doctrine, what ever it be, before thou ſeeſt the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus, bearing witneſſe to the truth of that in thy own ſpirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. for Sathan, Antichriſt, and his falſe miniſters, and Apoſtles, are now very thick to be ſeen, in the forme and ſhape of true Miniſters, and good Angels, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, looke well to your communion, delight not, nor be be not taken up two much with thoſe who do preach and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:113757:65"/>glory in that, which is not within the meaſure or compaſſe of their ſtrength and underſtandings, boaſting of things which they never ſaw, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12.13: <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. vainely puft up, with deepe ſecrets, Divine myſteries, unknowne paradoxes, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18.

               <p>O Bewitched; deceiving Antichriſt, I have ſome Requeſts to preſent unto thee and they are theſe; firſt, you that are perfect men, you that can yeeld obedience ſo, as to be made and called, and ſo become Divine and God, if ever you
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:113757:65"/>would helpe and deliver a poore miſerable damned Creature,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bright Star</hi> That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God did or thought from eternity, is diſcovered and made knowne to man, pag. 183. it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that this ſhould be true unleſſe man were infinite, Rom. 11.33.34.35. Job 26.14. Chap. 11.7.8.9.12. Iſa. 40.13.14.15. 1 Cor. 2.16. hee that hath the minde of Chriſt is not, whilſt hee is in this world perfect in knowledge, neither doth he know all things in ſuch an Infinit manner as God doth, 1 Cor. 13.12. Chap 15.52.53.</note> according to your notion, out of miſery and darkeneſſe, one that hath had God and all; but now have ſold him and all to the Devill; and doth ſtill remaine in an eſtate of Emnity and Rebellion againſt God if your Religion be a truth, then grant theſe petitions that I put up to you, and I will come into your Congregation, and before ten thouſand people deny all that I have written, and willingly ſubmit to you, the Requeſts are; theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That you would but bring me into that place where I may injoy but one houres communion; with the ſpirit of that godly Prieſt, which made that booke that is ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended by you, but is dead as you ſay, above two hundred yeares agoe, that I may be Informed, convinced and converted by him, if man be God as both you and he doe ſay, Then is this poſſible and eaſie for you to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, God is al wayes in communion with himſelf, and knows all things in himſelfe, for all things are God, and are in God, neither is it poſſible that he ſhould ever ceaſe from his beeing, one and the ſame for ever;</p>
               <p>Secondly, In all reſpects declare unto me, what is the preſent motion and univerſall frame of every Creature, that hath a being upon the face of the whole Earth, the Words of the Holy Spirit are; that all things are naked and open before him, with whom we have to doe. Shew me the way of an Eagle in the aire, the number of haires on thy head, and tell me how many meaſures of duſt there is upon the face of the earth; how many ſands upon the Sea ſhore, and the winde that bloweth upon the earth, which ſome affirme is God, tell me from whence comes it, and whether doth it goe? I ſay ſtill that God knows all things, but I cannot yet ſee that the winds and the ſea doe yeeld obedience to thee.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:113757:66"/>
               <p>My third Requeſt is this, tell me you that have obtained perfection, whether at all times, and in all eſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions whatſoever, you have and can have according to your will, preſently at your commandement, all things that you ſtand in neede of, to free you from all poverty, ſickneſſe, or any other trouble, that doth here in this eſtate of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, commonly befall you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">See Theologia Germanica, That God is good, or to be made good, chap. 4. and yet he is ſuch a good, as he is neither this nor that good, that can be named knowne or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, but is alſo and above all, pag. 19. line 6.</note> ſhew me who it is, and how it is poſſible, by any meanes that can be thought of, or imagined by the heart of any deified man, to make God good, who is a beeing of Infinite goodneſſe, laſt of all come and declare to me, where I ſhall be, and what I ſhall be, at all times, and in all places, whilſt I have beeing in this World, doe you not know that ſome have undertaken to diſcover unto many, what ſhall befall them while they are in this World?</p>
               <p>You ſay that God is ſuch a thing as cannot be ſpoken or written, but of him who is the ſelfe ſame thing and knoweth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>line laſt,</hi> hee who is not God cannot ſay it, now you doe grant that he that is the thing can know it, and ſpeake it, and none but hee, now ſhew me the man that will ſay that hee is God, I ſhould be glad to ſee him, and talke with him, and I doe beleeve if I could but meete with ſuch a one, that he would doe more good for me than all the men that ever I yet could ſee or meete with, God is not a ſhamed of himſelfe, neither is the afraid of man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrills, for wherein is he to be accounted of, be not aſhamed of your Religion, if you be God what are you a fraid of, you doe deliver your mindes in a corner, and are loath to ſpeake that at one time, which you will impudently affirme at another.</p>
               <p>And what is the Reaſon that you doe heare or preach at all, if the ſpirit of man be God, who doe you ſpeake to, to your ſelves? life you ſay is one in all Creatures, then what is it that you doe declare, you will ſay, that you doe diſcover God by Preaching, why? thou art God, and ſo am I too, what canſt thou diſcover, is there any thing beſides God, nay, is not every thing that hath any life or being, God? doſt thou Preach God, to God, why, hee is Infinite, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:113757:66"/>what can you Reveale to him? what is the Reaſon that many of you doe keepe a babbling in private and publike, is not all this needleſſe and to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, that you cannot feede your bellies and cloathe your backs, and provide for your Families without this, you muſt doe ſomething for a living; Anſwer, <hi>The earth is the Lords and the fullneſſe thereof,</hi> Secondly, God ſtands in neede of none of theſe things, he is not, nor cannot be ſubject to hunger and want as we are, and beſides all this Ile ſhew thee where thou doſt bring another groſſe contradiction and abſurdity upon thy ſelfe <hi>Germanica,</hi> pag. 45. line the 7. you ſay, that he who is it, and knoweth it, cannot ſpeake it, will you be your owne Judge in this, then doe but looke by the light of Reaſon, and you ſhall acknowledge the falſhood of theſe two, a forenamed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a God, that is true, Secondly, there is but one God, that is true alſo, is it not? now give me leave to diſcove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thy Familiſticall Atheiſme in this, if there be none of you that will deny this, that God is, and that there is not two but one, now how is it poſſible that either one or both of theſe ſhould hold true, by thy confuſed confounded Deſcription of God?</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſay that he that is God can know it, ſay it and write of it, this is a truth and cannot be denyed by any, that will acknowledge God, but how this a truth? why thus, it is a truth if it be right in its originall, in its ſenſe, and in its end, now take away any of theſe, and it ceaſeth from being a truth under all conſiderations, truth in all theſe is God.</p>
               <p>God is truths Originall, it came forth from God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.28. <hi>and</hi> 17.8. and was ever with God, Chap. 17.5. and 14.24. <hi>Proverbs</hi> 8.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1.2. and 3.11. the whole Scriptures doth witneſſe to the truth of this, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Act</hi> 15.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 10 43. <hi>Jere.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. Againe, the true ſenſe and meaning of truth, is not ſenſuall and carnall, but divine and Heavenly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. God is alſo all truth in its end, God is one in his end, as he is in beeing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4.5.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4.

               <p>Though men by reaſon can diſcover, and ſpeake that, that in many reſpects is true, yet if they ſeeke to make themſelves, Reaſon, or any other, the Originall of truth, they then doe no longer ſpeake it, but with-hold it in unrighteouſneſſe, as for an inſtance, or example, for a Familiſt, a Papiſt, or an Atheiſt to ſay that God is, or that there is one truth, which is God, now this ſaying is a truth, that is, ſo long as men hold it forth as the originall, but for any man to ſay that God is, and I am this God, Eſſentially he deſtroyes truth, and ſets up falſe-hood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſo long as truth, is kept to its own ſenſe, and diſcovered according to its owne meaning, it abides one and the ſame, I ſpeake now of it in reference to men, but when once a truth is ſpoken, and then a ſenſe or meaning brought in, either by Men or Divells, ſuch a ſenſe as is according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then is truth denied, and man ſeperated.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if truth doe not hold firme in its end, it is not then truth but errour, now truth in it ſelfe cannot be changed into a lye, but men with-hold it, and mixe their own minde and reaſon with it, ſo that whereas it was truth in the firſt, its now falſe in the laſt, for a man to ſay that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and to ſpeake it to an Antichriſtian Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſticall end, that he may by degrees allure and deceive, and ſo by ſpeaking one truth, put of a hundred hereſies, now judge what truth this can be, juſt as the Devill did to Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. Who did ſeeme to ground all upon a principle of truth, but to this end, that hee might overthrow him in the worke of Redemption.</p>
               <p>Againe, you ſay that he that is it, and knoweth it, meaning God, cannot ſpeake it, but if any deſire to know it, let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect untill he be the thing, now do but obſerve the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that I draw forth from your owne principles, if the ſpirit of man be God according to your many affirmations, then what ſenſe or Reaſon is there in this expreſſion, ſhould God expect to be that which he is from Eternity, but Ile go another way to worke, with you.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:113757:67"/>
               <p>You ſeem to hold forth thus much by this expreſſion; firſt, That there is a condition wherein man is and may be, in which he is not God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hee not being God in this eſtate, but having a deſire to know God, hee muſt expect untill he himſelf be that God, that hee deſires to know, now it is manifeſted plainly, that you ſay one thing now, and another anon, and doe not well know what to ſay, for it being a confuſed Religion that you plead for, I know no other way that you can have to plead for it, but in a way of confuſion.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for you, and altogether againſt all reaſon, both humane and divine, to goe about to maintaine order, by that that is confuſed and out of order, if you will but hearken to reaſon, I have by the light thereof ſufficiently proved and diſcovered, the falſhood and impoſſibility of maintaining, that opinion that you plead for, to be a truth, and of God, is it not impoſſible for any man, though never ſo great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in carnall wiſdome and Phyloſophicall underſtanding, to maintain a truth by a meer lye, to hold up a divine ſubſtance, by a meer ſhadow.</p>
               <p>Again, If man be not God, as in truth he is not, not in theſe reſpects that we have ſpoken of, then ſhall hee never bee God, for it cannot ſtand with the nature of any thing in God, to be, and yet not to bee, thou doeſt to the underſtanding of the weakeſt capacity, plainly in all thy concluſions deny the very beeing of God, for, I reaſon much with you under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Atheiſme, if there be any God at all, which you will not deny, then is it not poſſible that ever he ſhould bee ſuch a being as you deſcribe him to be; you acknowledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfectly, neither God, man, nor devill, but with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded mixture of all together; deny Scripture both with heart and tongue, and yet ſeemingly, for feare, to allure, for profit, faſhion, and cuſtome, draw all things from the Word, and would make that a cloak for all your hereſie, corruption, and outward filthineſſe, and becauſe the trueth of God can never be turned into a lye, God in his infinite and glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, overcome by the devilliſh oppoſitions, powers, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of the devill and antichriſt, who would faine drive
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:113757:68"/>all to this, to cauſe men to wonder at them, follow them, and acknowledge no other God, Chriſt; and Scripture, than themſelves, and thoſe words that doe proceed out of their mouthes.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the truth doth vindicate it ſelfe from all ſuch devilliſh interpretations, by inabling the Saints of the moſt high God, to goe forth in the power of the ſpirit, and to put to ſilence.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeeming Angelicall ſubtle beaſts, that would by their inchantments draw the whole world a wandering after them, therefore they blaſpheme.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſuch as ſpeak evill of thoſe things which they know not, they would that all men ſhould know, that none knows God but they, and under this notion, of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, they ceaſe not continually to breathe our evills and blaſphemies againſt him, whom in truth they never ſaw, and whatſoever they know by nature; as beaſts which are without ſuch a light of Reaſon now in all thoſe things which formerly they have known by the light of grace and all things that they now know by the light of Reaſon, in all theſe, for want of a true and powerfull principle of grace, to overcome and maſter their own proud ſelf-conceited imaginations of God and of all things, I ſay, that in all this they are moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably corrupted and defiled, confuſed and ſo confounded, that their own words will, and are already come in as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent witneſſes to judge and condemne them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 10.12, 13. Then is the love of a Chriſtian made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, when he doth feaſt his brethren, with all thoſe ſweet and glorious things that he hath received from God, but theſe men are clouds in ſuch feaſts of charity, who with one high eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word or expreſſion of God, will according to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, turn all joy into ſorrow, and all light into ſuch a myſticall darkneſſe, that though it be ſo, yet knowing men ſhall be ſo deceived, that they ſhall take it to be the higheſt light and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all, theſe are they that feaſt with you without all feare, feeding themſelves, for when wee aske them why they are ſo merry and joviall, they will anſwer that none have ſuch a right to all things as they have; and whatſoever they doe, they doe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:113757:68"/>it without feare, either to God or men, there being no account to be given to God, they themſelves being God, for one while they ſay that the ſpirit and life of all men are God: at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time they will ſay, that if any deſire to know God, let him expect, and ſo indeed hee may expect long enough before he be what they themſelves ſay they are.</p>
               <p>Theſe men doe preach and pray, feaſt, laugh, and talk, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of hell, ſin, death, or damnation, for there is nothing that ſhall remain to eternity but, the God-head that is in all creatures, they doe feed themſelves in two reſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They feed their bellies; Secondly, they feed their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies too, and they have many mens perſons in admiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe two advantages.</p>
               <p>Againe, In <hi>pag.</hi> 52. line 6. Hee ſaith, <hi>That perfect God and perfect man are one:</hi> how can this bed? why thus, Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfect unleſſe he be God, and God is not perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out man; ſo that perfect God, and perfect man, are one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, what ſenſe is there in all this, and what other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion can be drawn from theſe words? for, ſaith he, when man doth yeeld and give place to God, that then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there is man, and doe and leave undone whatſoever hee will.</p>
               <p>Wherein obſerve that God cannot be man, untill man give place to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That whatſoever work hee hath to doe, in that work he may bee diſturbed and hindered by the oppoſition of man, ſo that if man will, then God ſhall bee true man,
<note place="margin">See Theologia Germanica, pa. 8. lin. 3. pag. 52. lin. 7.</note> and work alone, and doe, and leave undone, whatſoever he will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When man will yeeld, then God becomes that that he never was before, for God is not man, nor man God, whileſt man is in rebellion, but when man doth ſubmit and give place to God, then God becomes man, and works alone, and does all things, but it cannot bee till then.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, How can this be? if the ſpirit of man bee God, then who muſt man yeeld and give place to? and upon what termes muſt it be done, muſt he give place to God? why, he himſelf is God, and muſt he give place to God, upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he may be deifyed? why, that by his own talk hee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:113757:69"/>is already, now is it not a ſenſeleſſe thing for a man that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in <hi>London,</hi> to goe a hundred miles about that hee may come to it, will any man bee ſo void of reaſon, as to give me ten thouſand pounds,
<note place="margin">Theologia Germanica, pa. 78. lin. 4. and ſo onward.</note> that hee may quietly poſſeſſe his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate which he hath already quietly in his poſſeſſion? He ſaith that there is no action but eſſence in God, that as God is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, light, love, truth and vertue, all is one eſſence in God, and that they cannot be brought into action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Then wee muſt conclude thus much, that good knowledge, light, love, truth, and vertue in God, are not nor cannot be brought into action.</p>
               <p>Let all the world that knows any thing judge of this, here bee two branches in this Doctrine; firſt, That there is no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but eſſence in God, and this I deny, for theſe Reaſons;</p>
               <p>Firſt, All things are in God, his eſſence comprehends and containes all things; <hi>ſee pag.</hi> 2. <hi>lin.</hi> 1. Now if there be nothing but eſſence in God, and yet all things are in him, then every creature is the divine and incomprehenſible eſſence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that if there be no action in God, then all creatures as they are in God, are without all life, beeing, and motion, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>Every creature doth live, move, and hath a beeing in God,</hi> this is an abſurd contradiction that they ſay. My ſecond Reaſon is this:</p>
               <p>All things in all heavenly, ſpirituall, and glorious reſpects, are the act of God alone, the creation, and preſervation of all things in heaven and earth, are the act of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Chriſtians Election, Redemption. Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eternall union with, through, and by the Lord Jeſus, is the glorious and unexpreſſible act of God.</p>
               <p>O Chriſtians, if it were not for this, where would your comfort and everlaſting glory be? but you ſhall heare Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in another language preſently. <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. He doth now confute himſelfe in ſuch a manner that I need not to ſpeak much concerning it, except it bee now and then a word, to helpe him, as I doe in all my writing, to make out his matter in plain Engliſh, hee ſaith, to God as God, it appertaineth that he lay himſelf open, know and love himſelfe, and that hee manifeſt himſelf to himſelf, in himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:113757:69"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> What need is there that I ſhould know that which I already know in ſuch a meaſure, as that I cannot by any meanes know any more?</p>
               <p>God is Infinite in the knowledge of himſelfe and of all things in himſelfe, without all beginning, without all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in knowledge from Everlaſting to everlaſting, but is, or can all this be without Action, now hee calls Gods opening of himſelfe to himſelfe, the diſtinction of perſons, this cannot be true in that Reſpect whereunto he ſpeakes it, in the deified man there is ſomething, ſaith hee, which belongeth to God, and not to the Creatures, and this God is in himſelfe without the Creatures, Originally, or Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, not in forme or Action, becauſe he cannot conceive of God to be brought into forme or action according to men therefore he denyes all motion in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth it but in this, marke the next, and yet, ſaith he.</p>
               <p>God would have this ſame, what is that; put in practiſe, God wills a thing without motion, can that be? I meane a Divine motion, a life that is Infinite, as God is all in his workes in reference to himſelfe, for ſaith hee there it is, where is it? that it might be conferred into action and ſo exerciſed, now hee gives you Reaſons enough himſelfe to prove this, if there were, ſaith he, no action but Eſſence in God, what ſhould God be? ſhould he be Idle, what then ſhould it profit, for that which is of no uſe (be carefull in Reading,) is not at all, now this neither God nor Nature would have, but if God would have himſelfe exerciſed and brought into action, which cannot be done without the Creatures, it is then neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo done, what then? if it were neither this nor that, nor if it were not any worke or action or the like, what ſhould it be, or what ſhould God himſelfe become to be, or what ſhould he himſelfe be? Now by theſe queſtions; all which, are his owne, he hath ſaved me a labour: one word or too to the mad man in his three particulars, that God is the Creatures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaſonableneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that God gave himſelfe and all to man, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>an ſold God and all to the Devill, Laſt of all that God
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:113757:70"/>aſhumes an Angell of darkneſſe, here lyes the mad ſimple contradiction, of this ſhee female Familiſine, in it ſelfe. Firſt, if man be God, ſo hee hath bin from Eternity, for God hath no beginning, now to whom ſhould man ſell himſelfe and all to, to himſelfe? can God give any thing to himſelfe that hee hath not in himſelfe, now as you ſay all things are God and are in God, there is nothing, beſides God or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, this Ile prove by more then a hundred expreſſions in your writings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if man ſold God and all to the Devill, than man had a greater power then God, or was God willing to ſell himſelfe to the Devill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if God bee ſold, then hee ſtands in need of a Redeemer, or of a Ranſome; Now who can Redeeme God? Who can give a ſufficient Ranſome to deliver him out of the hands of the Devill, what, there is two Eternalls, is there, and thou art one of them, prethee which is the greateſt?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this cannot be, by thy owne words, for ſometimes you ſay that there is but one Spirit or one God, ſometimes you ſay that the body or outward organ of man is without beginning and without end, being hid potentially in God, and ſometimes thou ſayeſt that God, is both God, Man Devill, and all things, now how can this ſtand, or how can God be ſo, and be called ſo: now if there be but one God, then what Devill can there be, and to whom can the Almighty, Omnipotent, and Infinite, ever bleſſed God be ſold to, Doeſt thou not blaſpheme; this Monſter I have already ſtrangeled, therefore Ile ſpeake no further to it.</p>
